无歌词无歌词And there was light
and the darkness that followed blinded my eyes
The night
made me trustworthy and hid all my lies
I called
the seventh of the eight and gave him my offer
So cold
were the feelings I bore inside after I'd lost her
Sometimes
I still can hear
his voices calling, calling me from everywhere
And now and then
I feel my soul
slowly slipping out of myself into his...
Hell
close my eyes and makes me forget
To tell
her of the deal and the conditions I met
And now
it's far too late to tell her what's going on here
Somehow
I'm almost looking forward to when this is over
"I felt my ghost cross over, and knew he was near,
and across the river I could see him standing there."
(solo)
And there was light
and the blackness that followed blinded her eyes
The night
drew her to me and we met in the dark
And this
why am I here? were the words that she said
A kiss
told her I was responsible for her being dead
She cried in silence and I wiped away her tears
She felt my cold hand amplifying her fears
She knew where she was and she cursed her beloved
And all of a sudden it all was over
Sometimes
I still can hear
his voices calling, calling me from everywhere
And now and then
I feel my soul
slowly slipping out of myself into his Hell
I know he's waiting there for me
in his limbo between destination and reality."作曲 : Taka

Prophetion
A gap between the scenes
Severs the present and the time to come
On the layers of the outer heaven
Hidden omens are found
The one who seeks
May find the end of the line
But the one who also sees
Makes out the meaning of the signs
The brightest star is dying
The forgotten becomes the light
After the seventh circle is complete
Red sand will cover the ground
When the third man arrives
Red blood tames the hate
Gold turns into iron
Into the blade of the tyrant's fate
To the sign of the Raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tide to time
The eyes of the Viper lead
Me through the darkest woods
Under the wings of the Phoenix
I land onto the nest of the truth
To the sign of the Raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tide to time
The eyes of the Viper lead
Me through the darkest woods
Under the wings of the Phoenix
I land onto the nest of the truth
To the sign of the Raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tide to time
The eyes of the Viper lead
Me through the darkest woods
Under the wings of the Phoenix
I land onto the nest of the truth作曲 : Altti Veteläinen & Pasi Hiltula & Jarmo Puolakanaho & Antti Kokko

Let the fire burn
And the ashes drown your past
Let the rain fall down
And wash the ruins of your life
When the wind is blowing
It dries the sands of decades
A new growth is born
And it's ready for a new flame
At the moment of silence
I feel like I am the one
Who was chosen to stay
And find out where this all begun?
Fire is burning me
Desire to set us free
The choirs of glory
Have now turned to silence
The sound of the aeon
Arias of the oldest ones
Once so beautiful a flower
Has now lost its blaze
Young fallen child
Now is sleeping so pale
At the moment of silence
I feel like I am the one
Who was chosen to stay
And find out where this all begun?
Fire is burning me
Desire to set me free
The wild stream of time is surging
It's flowing free
It has a grip on me
A grip on you eternally
Dark dreams of the past are calling
With agonies
They are haunting me
Haunting you eternally, eternally
The wild stream of time is surging
It's flowing free
It has a grip on me
A grip on you eternally
Dark dreams of the past are calling
With agonies
They are haunting me
Haunting you eternally, eternally
The wild stream of time is surging
It's flowing free作曲 : Jarmo Puolakanaho & Pasi Hiltula & Antti Kokko & Altti Veteläinen

I hear the silent whispers,
Darkness still upon me,
All those empty words
from the buried heart
I don ’t know where fear ends
and where hate begins,
It ’s all the same to me,
Life is falling apart
Hand in hand …side by side
I walk with fate in the night
The red fluid of life is flowing right along my arms,
I feel the sweet blade diving deep inside,
This moment I ’ve been waiting for so long a time,
when I know the last cut will be for my life
I ’ve looked through the eyes of pain
and seen the smile of death
I ’ve wandered in the shadows of my fears
The feathers of a white dove
were stained by darkened tears
The final tune is soon to be played
Hand in hand …side by side
I walk with death in the nightUnder a darkened sun, they are born
When the moon is losing its shape
I'm here again to see
Nightly dance of the flames

Once my father bore his sword
To defend the clan till the end
Now he braves the battles
Between red northern flames

In the silence of night
I stare at those ancient lights
Which enlighten the way from the cradle
And lead warriors in grave
They have always been
And they will never change
They light the fire of soul
And keep it burning bright

And behind the scattered clouds
Star field of the sky
Brings back the dreams I already lost

Shall I ever be like him?
Brave warrior of night
Whose name will be
Written on the northern lights

In the silence of night
I stare at those ancient lights
Which enlighten the way from the cradle
And lead warriors in grave
They have always been
And they will never change
They light the fire of soul
And keep it burning bright作曲 : Antti Kokko & Jarmo Puolakanaho

Like frozen leaves
We are falling
On to the soil so barren and cold

The rays of sun
No more warming
Our hearts now so cold

Through this field
Of the withered flowers
We go still one more time

The hidden beauty
Forever gone
The river's frozen once again
So came this time
When moonlight blackened my heart:

I can't stand this pain

The chain is broken
It's tearing open my scars:

I want to feel the flame...again

The shine behind
The frozen stream

Reminds me of your eyes

The spark of hope
Still in my heart

Shall dreams become true under the iceThough we are not Kommunisten
Or arrogant Rassisten
You can call us Idioten
But love shouldn't be forgotten
Those who claim to be Sadistisch
I would call them narzissistich
I suggest you schau mich an
Altogether join den Clan!
Come on und tanz mit uns!
No one will halt uns aux!
Lazy ****s and stupid Schlampen
Stand up and prepare for Kampfen
Let's put out our Zigarretten
And put out our leather Masken
There's no need for Polizei
Just breathe deep: aah… aah… ai!
Ooh! Grosses Deutches Land!
Du ziechst wunderbar!
Mein beloved Komissac
The way you take me ist wunderbar!
Punish me and lock me up
We'll enjoy the game of ****!
I am feeling like in hell
As you tell me \"undress schnell\"
After our games of Leidenschaft
Let's wonder off into the Nacht!
Ooh! Grosses Deutches Land!
Du ziechst wunderbar!
Ooh! Grosses Deutches Land!
Hey!无歌词I go all the way
Night and day
Women, booze and money
It's all just a game
Hit and run
That's how I play
All or nothing
That's the winners way
When I woke up this morning
Everything was clear
Besides my head
Who is the lady in my bed?
I'll shoot the moon
Nice girls won't tell
Thanks for nothing
I'll be on my way to hell

Sweet lady luck on my side
I got ace in the sleeve
Dead man's hand
I'm armed to my teeth
There is no trick in the book
That I wouldn't know
Cross me and feel
The embrace of the rope
I'm a high roller
Gambling my life every single day
I'm not a poser
Because the card of my life is two of spades

Jos käy niin, että tänään kuolen
Esi-isien luo, ajan tuolle puolen
Edessäin seisovat Valhallan portit
Kädessäin hyvin pelatut elämän kortit
Jos käy niin, että tänään kuolen
Esi-isien luo, ajan tuolle puolen

Kädessäin hyvin pelatut elämän kortit
I'm a high roller
Gambling my life every single day
I'm not a poser
Because the card of my life is two of spades
I'm a high roller
Gambling my life every single day
I'm not a poser
Because the card of my life is two of spadesWith contamination comes fever:
The disease is at its worst.
Teeth missing, beyond repair,
Fragile flesh falling away.
With fever, with virus comes the harshest judgment.
Haunting elements create a horrific monster.
You are never seen such grey skin,
Freezing to the touch.
This is a call to arms, human race.
Immune to water,
Immune to weather all to spread the curse.
Bones brittle ready to snap,
Mind unstable highly enraged.
Dirt underneath the nails of
Fingers tearing at your sanity.
There is no changing structure,
There is no retracting anatomy.
This architecture,
It cannot be destroyed.
There is no retraction... no retraction.
Close your eyes, but nothing changes.
We all know what brings this on... what brings this on.
Close your eyes, still nothing changes.
No one knows... no one knows how to take it back.无歌词I’ll endure the exile
I’ll endure the exile
The darkness of night falls around my soul
And the hunter within loses control
Gotta let it out - gotta let it out
Gotta let it out - gotta let it out
This demon inside has ahold of me
Clenching its power - trying to break free
Gotta let it out - gotta let it out
Gotta let it out - gotta let it out
Move fast, baby - Don’t be slow
Step aside – reload – time to go
I can’t seem to control
All this rage that’s inside me
Pullin’ shots – aimin’ dots – Yeah I don’t miss
Branded by Fire – Born in the abyss
Red hot temper – I just can’t resist
All this vengeance inside me
All of these thoughts runnin’ through my head
Arm on fire, veins burnin’ red
Frustration is gettin’ bigger
Bang Bang Bang – Pull my Devil Trigger!
Embrace the darkness that’s within me
No hiding in the shadows anymore
When this wickedness consumes me
Nothing can save you and there’s no way out
I’m a wildfire you won’t tame
Igniting my temper, can’t put out my flame
There’s no way to contain
This storm swelling inside me
I’m a bomb you can’t defuse
Might just accept you’re gonna lose
Can’t turn down, I refuse
to hold back anymore
All of these voices inside my head
Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang Bang Bang – Pull my Devil Trigger!
When the night ends it’s not over
We fight through to get closer
Like a silver bullet piercing through
I throw myself into you
All of these voices inside my head
Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang Bang Bang – Pull my Devil Trigger!无歌词Dreamscape in a blanket silver grey
Homesick for a memory washed away
All light in hollow eyes is stardust
(stardust)
Once you learned there is no return to lies
Haven't cried as we left the earth to die
Homesick for a memory in silencing eternally
Bring me to life
Bring me the starlight
Bring me the sun and moon
Release this star tonight
Bring me to life
Bring me the starlight
Bring me the sun and moon
Release this star tonight
Far away in a distant memory
There is lush
There is beat in you and me
Now all blood in a hollow heart is stardust
(stardust)
Washed away
Like your face drawn in the sand
At the edge of the sea is how we end
Painful is the memory
We did it to ourselves !
Awaken me
Bring back my heartbeat
Bring back the warmth of skin
The world we're living in
Bring me to life
Bring me the starlight
Bring me the sun and moon
Release this star tonight
Bring me to life
(Dreamscape into grey)
Bring me the starlight
(Homesick, all washed away)
Bring me the sun and moon
Release this star tonight
Bring me to life
Bring me the starlight
Bring me the sun and moon
Release this star tonight
Bring me to life
(Dreamscape into grey)
Bring me the starlight
(Homesick, all washed away)
Bring me the sun and moon
Release this star tonight无歌词作词 : Dave Bassett/B. Connors/Lzzy Hale
Don't listen what your girlfriend says
She reads those magazines
They say you failed the test
You don't have what she needs
I slither like a viper
And get you by the neck
I know a thousand ways
To help you forget about her
That bitch can eat her heart out!
Love bites
But so do I!, so do I!
Love bites
But so do I!, so do I!
Love bites!
My lips are pale and vicious
You're foaming at the mouth
You've suffered in the darkness
I'll suck the pain right out
So come and taste the reason
I'm nothing like the rest
I'll kiss you in a way
You'll never forget about me
That chick can eat her heart out
Love bites
But so do I!, so do I!
Love bites
But so do I!, so do I!
So do I!
It checks you in and kicks you down
It chews you up and spits you out
It messes with your sanity
By twisting all your thoughts around
They say it's blind, they say it waits
But every time it seals your fate
Now it's got you by the balls
And won't let go until you fall
I was down and out got up!
I said "hey, love, I've had enough"
I've felt pleasure without pain
My soul, you'll never tame!!!
Love bites
But so do I
Love bites
But so do I!, so do I!
Love bites
But so do I!, so do I!
So do I!
Love bites
But so do I!, so do I!
Love bites!

By  the  last  breath  of  the  fourth  winds  blow
Better  raise  your  ears
The  sound  of  hooves  knocks  at  your  door
Lock  up  your  wife  and  children  now
It's  time  to  wield  the  blade
For  now  you  have  got  some  company
The  Horsemen  are  drawing  nearer
On  the  leather  steeds  they  ride
They  have  come  to  take  your  life
On  through  the  dead  of  night
With  the  four  Horsemen  ride
or  choose  your  fate  and  die
You  have  been  dying  since  the  day
You  were  born
You  know  it  has  all  been  planned
The  quartet  of  deliverance  rides
A  sinner  once  a  sinner  twice
No  need  for  confession  now
Cause  now  you  have  got  the  fight  of  your  life
The  Horsemen  are  drawing  nearer
On  the  leather  steeds  they  ride
They  have  come  to  take  your  life
On  through  the  dead  of  night
With  the  four  Horsemen  ride
or  choose  your  fate  and  die
Time
has  taken  its  toll  on  you
The  lines  that  crack  your  face
Famine
Your  body  it  has  torn  through
Withered  in  every  place
Pestilence
For  what  you  have  had  to  endure
And  what  you  have  put  others  through
Death
Deliverance  for  you  for  sure
There  is  nothing  you  can  do
So  gather  round  young  warriors  now
and  saddle  up  your  steeds
Killing  scores  with  demon  swords
Now  is  the  death  of  doers  of  wrong
Swing  the  judgment  hammer  down
Safely  inside  armor  blood  guts  and  sweat
The  Horsemen  are  drawing  nearer
On  the  leather  steeds  they  ride
They  have  come  to  take  your  life
On  through  the  dead  of  night
With  the  four  Horsemen  ride
or  choose  your  fate  and  dieIron Maiden  - Fear Of The Dark

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark.
Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light ?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you.
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there.
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there ?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there
SOLO
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  xN
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense,and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind.
When I'm walking a dark roadIn the night we break the sorrow
In the night we come alive
In the night adrenalin is higher than heaven
In the night with no tomorrow
In the night the demons rise
In the night when carnal lust is higher than heaven
The cross on your wall, and demons inside
Come raise my sword to heaven
The night to be fall the pulse of the tide
The bell did strike eleven
And when the night has come
No, we never will return
Where the mortal pray resurrection
When the light has gone
In the sacristy we turn up high... and wake
In the night we break the sorrow
In the night we come alive
In the night adrenaline is higher than heaven
In the night with no tomorrow
In the night the demons rise
In the night when carnal lust is higher than heaven
We call on the dark, the Lord by our side
Take on the cross in heaven
We ride till we fall, unbroken we die
We strike by force of seven
And when the night has come
No, we never will return
Where the mortal pray resurrection
When the light has gone
In the sacristy we turn up high... and wake
Higher than heaven -
Higher than heaven -
Higher than heaven -
Higher than heaven -
In the dark of night we go to heaven
In the night we follow
The sundown we call, in twilight we hide
The night we still remember
We pray for them all, and restless we fight
And no, we won't surrender
And when the night has come
No, we never will return
Where the mortal pray resurrection
When the light has gone
In the sacristy we turn up high... and wake
In the night we break the sorrow
In the night we come alive
In the night adrenaline is higher than heaven
In the night with no tomorrow
In the night the demons rise
In the night when carnal lust is higher than heaven无歌词无歌词无歌词My Last Serenade

When the people fears the government there is Tyranny.
When the government fears the people, there is Liberty."Her penultimate sighs
Called softly on the kindling winds
Her saintly eyes, filling with tears, lifting with truth
And then a golden flash like the onset of Heaven
Leaving her screams, Breaking my heart
And in the grip of fire
I knew the death of love"
Where will you be when they tense for warfare?
What will you see with your innocence there?
Where will you be my darling?
Where will you be when God is glorifying?
There we will be between the dead and dying
Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain
For lying passive in the shadows whilst the enemy reigns
Devoted to the votive, holy standard above
'By command of the king of Heaven'
Came the death of love
Where will you be when they're vilifying?
How will they see when the truth is blinding?
Where will you be when the dark is rising?
How will you keep from it's terrorizing?
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
On the saintly iron maiden as she fell from her wound
But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above
To Lord upon the slaughter
Like a sword through hissing water
She arose where archers sought her
For the death of love
The righteous death of love
Gilles adored her drama
Her suit of pure white armour
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light
And as they rallied onto night
A cancer fled his soul
Dissolving...
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame, a Valkyrie
She made him click without desire
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when they caught her breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?
How will you know if the sky is burning?
Where will you be when Babel builds my fire?
Will you not flee and label me pariah?
Where will you be when they light my pyre?
Aligned with Joan in all
That was enthroned and divine
He swore to score the crimes
Jackdaws poured on this dove
Crimes he knew alone
Derived from minds of the blind
The church unfurled for murder perched
Upon the death of love
She claimed the sky was lit with spires
And even when she fought for breathA secret place silent as a grave
Oh, what a night I need to be saved
Moonbeams dance they are my guide
The days is lost in the dead of night
And I sat with my back against a cold stone
Waiting for you don't leave me alone
You're my dream my reality
Don't fade away don't hide away from me
Lady Moon you're holding the crow
Save my life before I drown
Queen in black your glory will shine
To the Moon is back for all of time
Let us sail with your ship up to the moon
In the clam of the night out of the blue
As my time runs out like sand through my hand
The nightmares leave at your command
I feel in this night you're close to me
Dance like a shadow now and I set you free
I'm paralysed love at first sight
Lady Moon so cold so bright
Lady Moon you're holding the crow
Save my life before I drown
Queen in black your glory will shine
To the Moon and back for all of time
Save my life before I drown
Queen in black now you come back
I'm always by your side
Even if we're world's apart
In the heat of the night
You will be mine
Lady Moon you're holding the crow
Save my life before I drown
Queen in black your glory will shine
To the Moon and back for all of time
Lady Moon you're holding the crow of time
Save my life before I drown of time
Queen in black your glory will shine
Flying to the moon and back now
Flying to the moon and back now
To the moon and back
My queen in blackWaiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park
Summer night city
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breath and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park
Summer night city
It's elusive
Call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow
When it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream
It's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhereKauan sitten kylän päässä syntyi kaksi poikaa,
kaksi perillistä sodanjumalan karhuntaljoin verhotun.
Jo kolmen iästä, sanovat, toisiansa alkoivat harjoittaa
ja kun teräksensä yhteen kalahti, saattoi kuulla ukkosen.

Kauan sitten kylän päässä varttui kaksi poikaa,
kaksiko vain typerystä kuolemaa pilkkaamaan?
Ei yksikään haava vielä ollut tehnyt
tehtäväänsä
ja siksi kai sitä miekasta vihollisen täytyi anoa.

Aina kunnia houkuttaa nuorta kansaa
(ryöstöretki merten taa) ja taistelu sitäkin enemmän.
Varmaan turmaan rientävän tielle
vain toinen hullu uskaltautuu.

Kun kenttä hohkaa kärsimystä ja kirveet lentävät,
leikki kanssa kuoleman vain yltyy.
Niin riemukasta lapsien on päitä pudottaa
kuunnellessaan sotajoukkoa hurraavaa.

Usein käykin vain niin et' vertaisesta tulee alempi.
Tarinan kulku voitoista kääntyy
ja maine ihmisen helposti antaa veljensä unohtaa.

Ylpeys, tuo kavalin tauti päällä maan,
näin on vienyt taas yhden uhrin muassaan.
Kumpi lie se epatto, kilpi alhaalla ja miekka koholla
teilleen mennyt vaiko hän joka hautoja kaivaa saa?

Heikompaa voima mik' riepottaa;
kotinsa on iäksi jättänyt tahtoen vielä surmata.

Distortion  Sleep
In  my  town  where  the  system  sleeps
Nobody  gives  a  damn
It's  up  to  you  how  to  hide  to  flee
Their  hunger  never  ends
Hateful  design  builds  the  structure  divine
A  territory  cold  as  ice
An  endless  empire  with  cynic  desire
Born  of  a  broken  spell
Feeling  like  a  guttersnipe  standing  in  line
Deciding  his  lifestyle  by  rolling  the  dice
One  will  stand  another  will  fall  down
Find  your  way  out  from  the  constant  lack
Feeling  like  a  guttersnipe  standing  in  line
Deciding  his  lifestyle  by  rolling  the  dice
One  will  stand  another  will  fall  down
Find  your  way  out  from  the  constant  lack
You  gotta  get  yourself  a  picture  of  what  is  going  on
Cause  their  lips  are  sealed  now
Their  honesty  never  to  be  found
Hateful  design  builds  the  structure  divine
A  territory  cold  as  ice
An  endless  empire  with  cynic  desire
Born  of  a  broken  spell
Feeling  like  a  guttersnipe  standing  in  line
Deciding  his  lifestyle  by  rolling  the  dice
One  will  stand  another  will  fall  down
Find  your  way  out  from  the  constant  lack
Feeling  like  a  guttersnipe  standing  in  line
Deciding  his  lifestyle  by  rolling  the  dice
One  will  stand  another  will  fall  down
Find  your  way  out  from  the  constant  lack
Your  pride  is  just  a  symbol
another  hidden  excuse
for  being  such  a  savior
distorting  your  sick  self  abuse
Feeling  like  a  guttersnipe  standing  in  line
Deciding  his  lifestyle  by  rolling  the  dice
One  will  stand  another  will  fall  down
Find  your  way  out  from  the  constant  lack
Feeling  like  a  guttersnipe  standing  in  line
Deciding  his  lifestyle  by  rolling  the  dice
One  will  stand  another  will  fall  down

谢谢thank  you~I've lost the train of my life
Due observation of others grief
And by the time my environment ruins
I will feel nothing but impotence
A sigh condenses my laments
Falling down to Earth through dirty rain
Sliced into thousand of new drops
And spreading my hopes with'em all
All my remembrance
Reflected as in a kaleidoscope
Over the vast sphericity
Of its shaved surface
Fake illusion
Detached exile
All my life has been so empty
Now that I know my time has gone
No more liquid flows inside me
All was dried with the heat of my wrath
Rot my entrails and scorched my sighs
Until the hole of wasted years was full
A breath of sick air escapes from me
Exhaled by a deep black lounge
Envenoms mankind with its sadness
A mental poison that cannot be cured
I've spent dead hours
Admiring the pass of time
Through an opaque raindrop
Across my window glasses
Fake illusion
Detached exile
All my life has been so empty
Now that I know my time has gone
And as I watch its march
Seconds don't stop at amy steps
Life slips by the hands
Of seasons I've mislayed.War, the very first war of our world,
When the treacherous witch was killed
Three times burned and three times born,
By searing flames was Gullveig torn.
Death, Odin hurled his spear off with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
battle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground.

The Vanir felt deceived
H?ne was a fool
without Mímir at his side
H?ne could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head

Truce, so a brittle and frail peace was forged
And to ensure that the peace remained.
Njordr and Freyr to Asgard came
and H?n' and Mim to Vanaheim
Death, see the furious gods wanting blood,
Odin knew that a raging war
would not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain.

純情　乙女な　メギツネよ无歌词There's a dream I have
It comes back when all the days turn into one
I'm in a coat and hat
And I'm standing on the coast of England
With a castle and cathedral on the sand
I reached down to touch the water with my hand
Then you turn and say to me
You've been talking in your sleep
What did you see? What does it mean?

I was a photograph
Of our daytrip from the window of a train
The one we cut in half
I kept mine and made a bookmark on a page
It fell out today as I was getting packed
Have I left you here more times than I've come back?
Like that snowfall out of reach
We kept our details underneath
Once made of stone, we went for broke
I didn't know




Are you a dreamer?作曲 : Danny Lohner & Trent Reznor
 作词 : Lohner, Reznor
So impressed with all you do
Tried so hard to be like you

Flew too high and burnt the wing

Lost my faith in everything

Lick around devine debris

Taste the wealth of hate in me

Shedding skin succumb defeat

This machine is obsolete

Made the choice to go away

Drink the fountain of decay

Tear a hole exquisite red

**** the rest and stab it dead

Broken bruised forgotten sore

Too ****ed up to care any more

Poisoned to my rotten core

Too ****ed up to care any more

Broken bruised forgotten sore

Too ****ed up to care any more

Poisoned to my rotten core

Too ****ed up to care any more

In the back
off the side
far away
is a place
where i hide
where i stay
tried to say

tried to ask

i needed to
all alone
by myself

where were you?
how could i ever think

it's funny how everything

that swore it wouldn't change

is different now
just like you

would always say

we'd make it through
then my head

fell apart

and where were you?
how could i ever think

it's funny how everything

you swore would
never change
is different now

like you said

you and me

make it through
didn't quite
fell apart

where the **** were you?Across the ocean
These flames can't provide me
with the warmth that I desire
The fire I need is a glimpse on the horizon
A beacon of hope
I'm coming home
Feels I'm in another world
If I walk too quickly I can almost fly
Cascading ,envelope ,I can't escape this
Luminescence everywhere
Light up the darkness
You are the cause of sickness
And the cure of disease
Bathe me in gold ,so that I may breath again
You are the cause of sickness
And the cure of disease

I once was sun-kissed
Now I lay frozen here
But the fire inside burns
bright ,adrenaline ,oxytocin
Give me the strength to
move beaven and earth
Realign us back in phase
I'll never leave again
You are the cause of sickness
And the cure of disease
Bathe me in gold ,so that I may breath again作曲 : McIlrath, Rise Against
Do you spend your days counting the hours you're awake
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
It's a burden you've been buried
In spite of all your prayers
There's a light turned off inside your heart
And you don't remember what it's like to care
Knees are weak hands are shaking I can't breathe
So give me the drug
Keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
But let me go
Pull this plug
Let me breathe
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go
The trail of crumbs you left
somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave
Then you only had to stay
But the memories that haunt us
Are cherished just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky
No matter how grave yet I fall through these clouds reaching are screaming
So give me the drug
Keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
But let me go
Pull this plug
Let me breathe
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go
This grip loosens but it never breaks （never breaks）
We carry nothing but again you will forsake
You words are always there to break my fall （break my fall）
In them I find the comfort
to see through it all
（Guide me through un-chartered waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass
Until forever until forever ends ）
Knees are weak hands are shaking I can't breathe
So give me the drug
Keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
But let me go
Pull this plug
Let me breathe
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me goWalk on Water
 Kiske / Somerville

 The first time I saw you
 I couldn't tame my emotions
 I couldn't sleep at night
 Caught between hot and cold
 I'm here to see alone
 And the north wind cried
 I tried to control my feelings
 I know for the first minute I'm caught in the game
 My heart was beating like a drum
 All was in vain

 Over the mountains and the seas
 I walk on water
 I'm drying all you tears
 Over the mountains and the seas
 I'm calling out your name
 I'm taking all your fears away

 My eyes so wide open
 As I saw you leaving
 And my world was falling apart
 You left me bleeding
 I'm standing beside you
 But I'm not sure what I'm gonna do
 When I was trying to forget you
 I couldn't go on, but now the tables have turned
 I'm ready to break these chains
 Don't let it slip away

 Over the mountains and the seas
 I walk on water
 I'm drying all you tears
 Over the mountains and the seas
 I'm calling out your name
 I'm taking all your fears away
 Am I dreaming
 Can you feel it
 Am I the only one
 Who sees the signs
 Will you believe me
 Beg you one last time
 I'm gonna save us now

 Over the mountains and the seas
 I walk on water
 I'm drying all you tears
 Over the mountains and the seas
 I'm calling out your name
 I'm taking all your fears away
 Over the mountains and the seas
 I walk on water
 I'm drying all you tears
 Over the mountains and the seas
 I'm calling out your name
 I'm taking all your fears awayI am alone
And I feel my body in pain
I wish somebody was here to hold my hand till the end
My heart's buring out
My body is losing its sanity
This is really the end
No way back reserved for me
I wanna have a last look into your eyes
To remember how that love never cry
But I should know that there's no time left
To see your face the very last time in my life
Accepting the end
I'm waiting for it and never runs
Oh my god, the last breathe is already done
What will happen now
Am I in heaven, or am I in hell
Would you please tell me what will happen to my soul
It was never all the same to me
Yes I see the preach within my eyes
And the rainbow up in the sky
Are these your signs to show the way to a kingdom with a living
In eternity, always light and never dark
In eternity, with friends around we're living
In eternity, this place is right with its eternal light
Come and take my hand
You have always been my friend
There's a place reserved for you and heaven
Come and take this chance
Don't you see the preach within your eyes and the rainbow up in the sky
Yes these are the signs to show the way to a kingdom with a living
In eternity, always light and never dark
In eternity, with friends around we're living
In eternity, this place is right with its eternal light
Don't you see the preach within your eyes and the rainbow up in the sky
Yes these are the signs to show the way to a kingdom with a living
In eternity, always light and never dark
In eternity, with friends around I know, I know we are living
In eternity, always light and never dark
In eternity, your eternal light作曲 : John 5/Marilyn Manson

We're on a bullet
and we're headed straight into god
even he'd like to end it too
we take a pill, get a face
buy our ticket
and we hope that heaven's true
I saw a cop beat a priest on the TV
and they know they killed our heroes too
We sing the death song kids
because we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
and we want to be just like you
Let's sing the death song kids
we light a candle on an earth
we made into hell
and pretend that we're in heav
each time we do we get
the blind man's ticket
and we know that nothing's true
I saw priest kill a cop on the TV
and I know now they're our heroes too
We sing the death song kids
because we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
and we want to be just like you
Let's sing the death song kids
we write our prayers on a little bomb
kiss it on the face and send it to god
(CHORUS)
We were the world
but we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
we want to be just like you.Beware the serpents in the leaves
And their deception
An outstretched hands closed to a fist
Becomes a weapon
I see the damage they have done
I see the battle's just begun
I know the answer lies inside
I feel it when I close my eyes
Through disaster and decay
Survive to fight another day
There's no time for you to question
Every single step you take
Press on, and trust in your instincts
Trust in your instincts
Break down the barriers of fear
And superstition
Listen to your primal past
And intuition
You'll see the damage they have done
You'll see the war is never won
You'll know the answer lies inside
You'll feel it when you close your eyes
Through disaster and decay
Survive to fight another day
There's no time for you to question
Every single step you take
Press on, and trust in your instincts
Kill or be killed (stand and fight)
Sink or swim (run and hide)
The answer lies within
Through disaster and decay
Survive to fight another day
There's no time for you to question
Every single step you take
Press on, and trust in your instinctsWe die alone,
Sad fact of life
But you're getting old
And there's a certain set of things
You gotta know:
You're not special
You're not even close
Stop fighting,
You're losing your will to live
I can see it in your glazed-over eyes
Disappoin*******ent lies in your wasted youth
The sad fact is you never had a chance.
You're still not getting it
The sad fact that you're still not questioning
I've been telling you since 2010
Freedom is still a ******* lie.
I've been telling you since 2010
Freedom is still a ******* lie.
They've been walking round my town
Like they own the ground
Now they're hanging upside down
Tell me, who's the big man now?
Not ******* you.
Your ideology stinks like *******t
I don't wanna be any part of it
Tell me, who's the big man now?
Stop fighting,
You're losing your will to live
I can see it in your glazed-over eyes
Disappoin*******ent lies in your wasted youth
We will all die alone
There is no light
There is no way out.
We will all die alone
There is no light
There is no way out.
Stop fighting,
You're losing your will to live
I can see it in your glazed-over eyes作曲 : Glenn Tipton/Rob Halford/Richie Faulkner

I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
Twisted dreams that are formed from illusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
Lightning will strike!作曲 : Glenn Tipton/Rob Halford/Richie Faulkner

With weapons drawn we claim the future
And then seep out through every storm
Bring in the foe to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk to dawn
Firepower
Petrifies
Firepower

The die is cast, make no exceptions
We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally round this lack of freedom
Our unions rise so go to hell
Firepower
Taking lives
Firepower
Neutralize

Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives of danger
It's bound to explode
Aim for the target
With laser and lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight
No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace

We fight this firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
Between the eyes
Firepower
Mortifies
Firepower
Man's demise无歌词The flinch in your eyes calls your bluff
Feel free to die when you've had enough
Useless cause is breaking your back
Your life will end when you attack
Make your move
Make your stand
Make the win
Hah, like you can
See the war
See me rule
See the mirror
You'll see a fool
To take me out you must fight like a man
You've yet to proven that you can
I see your might it compares to something
That is if something is nothing
Time to figure
Time to sin
Your times done
When you begin
Live for suffer
Live for revenge
Know your life
Comes to an end
Taste the blood
Taste your fate
Swallow your pride
With your hate
Your last breath
Your last stance
The last of all
In your command
Knee's in the blood
With your crying pleas
Wade in your sorrow bathe
In your fear
Clear your mind
From righteousness suffered
Witness the moment your
Failures prosper
The flinch in your eyes calls your bluff
Feel free to die when you've had enough
Useless cause is breaking your back
Your life will end when you attack
Make your move
Make your stand
Make the win
Hah, like you can
See the war
See me rule
See the mirror
You'll see a fool
To take me out you must fight like a man
You've yet to proven that you can
I see your might it compares to something
That is if something is nothing
Time to figure
Time to sin
Your times done
When you begin
Live for suffer
Live for revenge
Know your life
Comes to an end
Taste the blood
Taste your fate
Swallow your pride
With your hate
Your last breath
Your last stance
The last of all
In your command
Knee's in the blood
With your crying pleas
Wade in your sorrow bathe
In your fear
Clear your mind
From righteousness suffered
Witness the moment your
Failures prosper
The flinch in your eyes calls your bluff
Feel free to die when you've had enough
Useless cause is breaking your back
Your life will end when you attackWhispered words beneath the floating autumn leaves
Flying softly on the southern breeze
Fragments of light between the branches and trees
I wish I would stay here forever
The sun is sinking behind mountains of old
Brushing faintly clouds of red and gold
Night-time's flinging a vast veil of velvet across fields and forest
Trespassing the havens of daylight's temporary borders.
I knew my game could gain me but grief, the fairy tale was on though brief
Trespassing the havens of secrecy's temporary borders.
Scratching the surface of times seemingly forgotten
Of you who once were mine betrothen
Digging 'neath layers of emotions now rotten
I feel myself slip away
Nostalgic entertainment tingled by the past
You were the one to be mine at last
But now my memory's ever fading so fast
Keeping emotions at bay
Here I sit, and memories unfold
My feelings are hollow,
I'm feeling so old
"I feel it fade away and cry tears in solitude"
Trespassing the havens of night-time's temporary borders
As shadows collapse in the mating of day and night, crows are circling in ominous flight
Trespassing the havens of my own temporary borders (temporary borders)
I tried...
I tried hard to believe
Thinking of us has left me but grief
I cannot look ahead, the past is all
I see Moments together, but time's a thief
Shadows recurring from times long since passed
Our time and now in a perfect contrast
 "As I see you sitting by my grave I feel your presence,
but can't say a word Your heart and love,
patient and brave But my soul is too late for you to save"
I am probably a fool still thinking of you
Night after night...
There's not much else
I can do For neither myself nor you
Maybe I should leave and never come back to this place...
But I know too surely that
I'm only fooling myself
I'm only fooling myself无歌词The only thing I ever wanted,
the only thing I ever needed
is my own way -
I gotta have it all
I don't want your opinion,
I don't need your ideas
stay the **** out of my face,
stay away from me
I am my god -
I do as I please
just wipe your own ass and - shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down - shut your mouth

what comes around you know goes around

my mind is playing tricks on me
I am not as stable as I used to be
pushed and shoved,
you know you're going too far

I will not break my back for you no more,
 I am gonna go my way
I am gonna take control
time to wake up and dig myself out of this hell

just wipe your own ass and - shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down - shut your mouth

what comes around you know goes around - shut your mouth

you're getting what your ego deserves - shut your mouth

what comes around you know goes aroundFear in me so deep
It gets the best of me
In the fear I fall
Here it comes
Face to face with me
Here I stand
Hold back so no one can see
I feel these wounds
Step down, step down, step down
Am I breaking
(Down)
Can I break away
Push me away
Make me fall
Just to see another side of me
Push me away
You can see what I see
The other side of me
Fall back on me
And I'll be the strength I need
To save me now
Just come face to face with me
Stay in place
You'll be the first to see
Me heal these wounds
Step down, step down, step
(Down, down)
Am I breaking
(Down, down)
Can I break away
Push me away
Make me fall
Just to see another side of me
Push me away
You can see what I see
The other side of me
(Side of me, side of me, side of me)
Go
Can I break away
Push me away
Make me fall
Just to see another side of me
Push me away
You can see what I see
The other side of me
No one can see
Anything on the other side of me
I walk, I crawl
Losing everything and waiting for the downfall
No one can see
Anything on the other side of me
I walk, I crawl
Losing everything on the downfall
Fall...As the evening breaks
The night awakes
And the land is mournfully wrapped in silence
Sorrow last
And remains the past
cause this will be my ending day
Then the moonlight dies
And torches rise
See the crowd longing for the ritual burning
Holy rhymes, as the churchbells chime
cause this will be my ending day
Silent thief
Take me away
Let my soul rest in the realm of fairytales
And as the fire enlightens the dark
I see the face bewildered with guilt
And nobody's speaking a word
As the dark night enters
See the soul that's coming out of darkness into light
Pictures, I can't fight
Appearing in front of my eyes
Like silhouettes in the night
Like they give bread to the beggars
They get ready for the feast
Cruelty absorbed by their eyes
Within this midwinters breeze
Silent thief
Take me away
Let my soul rest in the realm of fairytales
And as the fire enlightens the dark
I see the face bewildered with guilt
And nobody's speaking a word
As the dark night enters

Solo
In the silence of darkness, among the shadows of the dead we hear
a wolf howling hungry to wake up children of the graves
Unripe vengeance
The cult that serves as revenge
Has put forward it's fangs to declare a ****ing war
Only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by the altars of Bodom
where everything but death is a lie
To spill your blood to become our wine
We'll reborn really where only the wild will survive

The clash of wickedness veils Lake Bodom blood red
We have gathered our souls to praise the triumph of Death

yaooo

Children of Bodom
angry are rising
Running amok, slaying with a sense of desire
From the twilight of the past,among the victims who died
Something Wild
has survived

Almost everything
I knew became more f**king worthless
So many promises  so much energy

All I want is silence

All I want is peace  all I want is you

No more reason for searching for what
I always expected from life

New direction  new f**kin' rules

You caught me on my way to my new life

I think it's time to act selfishly

You caught me on my way to my new life
To my new life
Memories of a time before distrust and pain

Perhaps a dream  perhaps a trap

But not this time  it's too different

My pulse  slowing is slowing down
My eyes are closed now

My pulse  down

My pulse  down
My pulse is slowing now

A picture of the time
I draw it with my mind

It's colourful and bright
It's no longer waiting
From today it's arriving

This time I can see the sky

The first time I don't look back

What

No more walls  no more lies
I can breathe until after the sundown

My glowing heart
Just awakened perfection within reach

My sad memories

You make them look like fading dust

I am the air  I am the ground
Nothing can burn me down

I really missed this feeling
Now I don't fear myself anymore
Open mind  open ways
My future turns to light

Hope has come to find me

My real destination

This is the control I was waiting for
It makes me unbreakable

I remember who I am  what I was
What I've become作曲 : Aleksi Laiho

 The first man I killed was the earl's right-hand man
 When he came to take her away
 I ran his own sword straight through his throat
 And then I stood there, watching him fade
 The first blood I spilled was the blood of a bard
 I had to wipe his smile away
 I was not yet a man, nor was I a boy
 But still, I made that bastard pay
 So I left him there, on the stained floor
 Bathing in a pool of his own blood
 My one and only choice was to flee this land
 To leave this wretched place for good
 I am an outcast
 All alone
 I'm a nomad without home
 I am an outlaw
 I'm disowned
 And I am no man's son
 Through the cold midwinter nights on a southbound winding path
 The stars and moon my only light; and the earl's men closing fast
 I swore that I'd return; that I would see him burn
 I will live it in my dreams; the smell, the blood, his dying screams
 To my father I was dead, he took his name from me
 He drove me away, I was shunned
 My one and only choice was to leave this land
 To become the pagan they would hunt
 I am an outcast
 All alone
 I'm a nomad without home
 I am an outlaw
 I'm disowned
 And I am no man's son
 I am an outcast
 All alone
 I'm a nomad without home
 I am an outlaw
 I'm disowned
 And I am no man's son无歌词无歌词The Essence Of The Ashes-Eluveitie
And it came to pass
In those leaden days
That a plain, poor man
Got sick of his yoke
Of condemned soil
And foreign empires hungry purse
Time to replace
Pitchfork with sword
And sound the anthem
Of sheer rebellion
EnoughOnce too often
EnoughIs enough
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have
We tasted grime and blood
We know the essence of ashes
A glowing spark
Rising up from blazing flames
To lead the forlorn and wrath
The epitome of hope
A daring venture
A frantic attempt
When Amandus was slain
The Bagundae still sang
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have

We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights

my real story moves on
We will keep on fighting

Where do you then go and what are you looking for?

One day I just kept looking up to the sky
What do you take and what do you lose again
You know? You know? You know?I know!!
'Cause I will need to protect someone now for sure. Right?
This decision needs to be made on today
I've tried to imagine it over 100 times
Nobody knows this story
that I will put into an end start it over again!
あの日の僕は何処か遠く
知らない場所で目覚めた

Unser allerhöchstes Gut
Wurd uns bei der Geburt geschenkt
Doch du dies nicht zu schätzen weißt
So nutzt dein Leben nur beschränkt
Von all den Dingen dieser Welt
Nichts in Frage hast gestellt.
Geboren um zu leben
Um zu affektieren
Geboren um zu atmen
Um zu retardieren.
Du bist geboren um zu leben
Zeit ist für dich bedeutungslos
Denn dein Weg sich im Kreise schließt
Und das Wasser, in dem du treibst
Mit dir zusammen flussabwaerts fließt
Und wenn du letzten Endes stirbst
In Vergessenheit geraten wirst
Geboren um zu leben
Um zu affektieren
Geboren um zu atmen
Um zu retardieren.

The feeble leafs decline
Enshrined in downing deep
The mourn abandoned plains
Laid down in somber sleep
Misty shades engulf the sky
Like past,worn memories
The bird’s song fills the whispering breeze
With autumns melody

The lunar pale grim shape
At evening’s sight renews
It’s silented wail relieves
Repressed thoughts anew
I hear the lonesome choir
Of fortunes past my way
Disdained in fiery weeps
Throughout my every day
These skies I hail and treasure thee
Most pleasant misery
Not pittes thron I shelter thine
Mysterious harmony

Draw on most pleasant night
Shade my lorn exposed sight
For my grief’s when shadows told
Shall be eased in mist enfold
Why should the foolish’s hope
Thy unborn passioned cry exhaust unheard
Beneath this pleasant sky?
For if the dusking day declined
Could delight be far behind?作曲 : Traditional

As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier

I said Stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that shed love me no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
Theres whiskey in the jar-o
Being drunk and weary I went to Mollys chamber
Taking my money with me and I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
Theres whiskey in the jar-o
Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear to hear the cannon ball roaring

Me I like sleeping specially in my Mollys chamber

But here I am in prison here I am with a ball and chain yeah

In this beauty the world seems to sleep
The sleepless angels, they sing their songs
The songs of sorrow, like birds in the end
I'm still awake, listening the night
Don't want to be, no more alone
The sleepless angels, I hear them sing
The songs of grief, the songs of the end
In the sleepless nights
Everything's forever lost
Beneath the thousands stars
I don't want to be alone
In the sleepless nights
Everything's forever lost
Beneath the thousands stars
I don't want to be aloneI can't tolerate your sadness

cause it's me you're drowning

I won't allow any happiness

'cause everytime you laugh,

I feel so guilty

I feel so guilty

Am I forced to have any regret?

I've become the lie, beautiful and free

In my righteous own mind

I adore and preach the insanity you gave to me

Sell me the infection, it's only for the weak

No need for sympathy, the misery that is me

I've lost the ability to paint the clouds
'cause it's me you're draining

I'm stuck in this slow-motion dark day

cause everytime you run,

I fall behind

I fall behind

And so I hear my voice again

The tale of the bitter man, here I am

Shake the silence and hear what it says

The tranquil pride that become the lie

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak

No need for sympathy, the misery that is me

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak

On bleeding knees, I accept my fate

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak

No need for sympathy, the misery that is me

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak

 作曲 : John 5/Twiggy Ramirez
 作词 : Marilyn MansonI'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh God it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head
How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of folks
So while you're outside looking in
Describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head
How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart
But never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises
(Null and void instead of voices)
Before you tell yourself
It's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head
And it's the stars
The stars that shine for you
And it's the stars
The stars that lie to you, yeah
And it's the stars
The stars that shine for you
And it's the stars
The stars that lie to you, yeah
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh God it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head
And it's the stars
The stars that shine for you, yeah
And it's the stars
The stars that lie to you, yeah
And it's the stars
The stars that shine for you, yeah
And it's the stars
The stars that lie to you, yeah yeah
Who are the stars?
Who are the stars that lie?We'll choose our lives with blind intent
Haunt ourselves with fears of change
Struggle save, watch time repeat
Let them treat our innocence
Take our freedom, take our rights
Teach us how to conquer life
By the book, by guiding light
Within the lines of modern minds
Too many misery victims born and raised
Drip feed the casualties, turn it off
Turn it off! **** the company!
No faith!No faith, no faith in me!
There's no time to waste, landmines in the graves
Holding on to youth, refuse
And all you wanna know is, where we go in the end
Transfixed, dope sick, time to waste
And how do we get out of this hell that we live
My hatred's pulling me in
We'll choose our lives with blind intent
Haunt ourselves with fears of change
Struggle save, watch time repeat
Let them treat our innocence
Take our freedom, take our rights
Teach us how to conquer life
By the book, by guiding light
Within the lines of modern minds
Within the lines of modern minds
Don't give up, give up, give up on yourself
Brainwashed like everyone else
Don't bottle your dreams hide them away
Cold future, no escape
Don't speak knives, don't speak knives
Don't speak knives, at what our future could beNocturnal  Strains

I  feel  the  darkest  velvet  in  my  arms
我抚摸着臂间暗沉色的丝绒
I  follow  the  calling  tune,the  strains  of  the  darkest  night
追随这召唤的曲调，幽暗之夜的乐章
And  enjoy  the  silent  song  of  a  nightingale
聆听夜莺清静沉寂的吟唱
I  raise  the  silver  goblet  full  of  the  nightly  dew
我举起银色的高脚杯，盛满夜色的露水

品尝这忧伤之泪最甜美的滋味

黑暗深沉的时间之风在飘飞
Years  are  passing  by...
千百年逝去
But  the  sounds  of  night  remain  the  same...
夜晚的歌声依旧如斯…
I  see  valkyrias  dancing  with  rays  of  the  crescent's  light
我看见瓦尔基里们在新月的清辉下翩然起舞
Their  dance  is  so  enchanting...so  wild
她们的舞姿如此诱人…狂野如斯
They  come  to  share  the  last  dance  with  me
她们来和我一起共享这最后的舞蹈
Accompanied  by  the  nocturnal  strains
共享这深沉之夜的乐章
How  could  I  live,if  night  faded  away?
当夜色消散我怎能存活
I  would  lose  my  shield  and  the  place  to  hide...
我将失去庇佑和藏身之所
It  would  be  the  end  of  my  way  from  the  first  dusk  till  the  last  dawn...
那将是我生命之路的尽头，始于薄暮，黎明终了
The  Dark  wind  of  time  is  blowing...
黑暗深沉的时间之风在飘飞
Years  are  passing  by...
千百年逝去
But  the  sounds  of  night  remain  the  same...
夜晚的歌声依旧如斯…

Ministry - Lieslieslies

Does anybody else see a problem here?
If the government has nothing to hide
why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
This story does not add up

I'm on a mission to never forget
3,000 people that I've never met
We want some answers and all that we get
Some kind of shit about a terrorist threat
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Surprise surprise

I'm on a mission to dig up the truth
You think we're stupid and there's no proof
Well let me tell you that the time has come
To pull the trigger on the smoking gun
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Surprise surprise

Don't listen to me listen to your head
Don't listen
Don't listen to anything, they've said
Don't listen

America has been hijacked
Not by Al Qaeda, not by Bin Laden
But by a group of tyrants
That should be of great concern to all Americans

I'm on a mission to bring out the facts
You got your stories but they all have cracks
Misinformation, lies and deceit
What made you think that we were all asleep
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies
Surprise surprise

Don't listen to me listen to your head
Don't listen
Don't listen to anything, they've said
Don't listenGot no time to think about what they did to me
I have lost my former self and still I'm changing
Rain, come down on me - nightfall, won't you just set me free?
Rain, come down on me - rain on me
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
Banish me to feel safe in your prison of gold and morality
Cursing my birth as an aberration a sick child of subhuman breed
Life, it ends tonight - breaking the chains of eternity
Life, it ends tonight - set me free
What should I know? What should I do to get rid of you?
Your life to me equals nothing
Nightfall, come down on me - rain, won't you just set me free?
Nightfall, come down on me - rain on me
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
Take me back to where my soul still means a thing
I don't need your world of lies, just want release
Memories are just fading ghosts telling the story of someone else
I never had a past, the present is a lie and now I know my future is dead
Life, it ends tonight - breaking the chains of eternity
Life, it ends tonight - set me free
Rain, come down on me - nightfall, won't you just set me free?
Rain, come down on me
Rain on me
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows作曲 : Michael Amott

When I was born the seed was sown
I will not obey
my life is my own
Battle those
who wish to enslave me
Expose the lies that enrage me
I don't believe in heaven
I don't believe in hell
Never joined the herd
could not adjust well
Slave, master,

it's not for me
I chose my own path, set my self free

I, I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be

I, I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
The eagle flies alone
Reject the system
That dictates the norm
This world is full of lies
and deceit

I have felt betrayal

Cut so deep,
suffered defeat
Only to rise again
I I go my own way
I see my natural street
Forever I won't fight the power that be

I, I go my own way
I see my natural street
Forever I won't fight the power that be
The eagle flies alone

Alone

I I go my own way
I see my natural street
Forever I won't fight the power that be

I I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be

The eagle flies aloneI don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can
She's in the kitchen staring out the window
So tired of living life in black and white
Right now she's missing those technicolor kisses
When he turns down the lights
Lately feeling like a broken promise
In the middle staring down this town
There's only one thing in this world that she knows
He said forever and he'll never let her down
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can
She laid take out on the coffee table
Prepped the dishes poured a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
Here for the moment everything is alright
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can our love can move a mountain
Because we can if you believe in we
Because we can just wrap your arms around me
Because we can we can
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can our love can move a mountain
Because we can if you believe in we
Because we can just wrap your arms around me
Because we can we can
Because we canWho's there knocking at my window?
The owl and the Dead Boy
This night whispers my name
All the dying children
Virgin snow beneath my feet
Painting the world in white
I tread the way
And lose myself into a tale
Come hell or high water
My search will go on
Clayborn Voyage without an end
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone
Bring me back to life
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
It all starts with a lullaby
Journey homeward bound
The sound of a dolphin calling
Tearing off the mask of man
The Tower my sole guide
This is who I am
Escapist
Paradise Seeker
Farewell, time to fly
Out of sight
Out of time
Away from all lies
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone
Bring me back to life
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
It all starts with a lullaby
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone
Bring me back to life

Blut im Auge
Equilibrium-Sagas
Was ich sah auf meiner Reise
Scheint zu wahr es zu erz?hln
Drum versuch ich auf meine Weise
Euch mit mir dort hinzunehmn.
Wie ich einst auf dunklen Pfaden
Weit von hier in Nordens Land
Sah was mir den Atem raubte
Was ich bis da nicht gekannt.
Blut im Auge
Auf wunde Knie
So sank ich nieder
Was ich sah? lie? mich nicht mehr los'
Zu entdecken ihr Geheimnis
War die Nacht für mich verlohr'n.
Tag um Tag in grauem Regen
Suchte ich den Blick noch mal
War verfallen jenem Zauber
Den ich bisher nicht erahnt.
Blut im Auge
Auf wunde Knie
So sank ich nieder
Lies zurück der St?dte Tore
zog hinauf in eisige H?'n
Sturmgewitter' Donners Peitschen
Suchten mich zu Grund zu gehn
Blickte in des Wassers F?lle
Hinter Str?ucher' Birkenhain
Unruhig Blicke' grau die Wogen
Wo mag sie geblieben sein?
Schlaflos' rastlos such ich...
Lautlos' raunend' h?rt sie mich nicht...
über Felsen' Berg und Heide

Such ich sie bei Nacht' die Wei?e

Er predigt uns von Verzicht
Dass Reichtum uns kein Glück verspricht
Wer gierig ist, wird niemals satt
Wahrlich reich ist, wer nichts hat
Es ist immer das gleiche Spiel
Der eine hat zu wenig
Der andere hat zu viel
Scheinfromm
Scheinfromm
Sie glauben, was er tut kund
Das Volk lebt mit der Hand im Mund
Sich gierig nun die Hände reibt
Da so für ihn mehr übrig bleibt
Es ist immer das gleiche Spiel
Der eine hat zu wenig der andere zu viel
Scheinfromm
Scheinfromm
Scheinfromm
Scheinfromm
Nun sitzt er da, auf seinem Geld
Er glaubt doch selbst nicht, was er uns da erzählt
Es ist immer das gleiche Spiel
Der eine hat zu wenig
Der andere hat zu viel

Ich schreibe einen Hit
Die ganze Nation kennt ihn schon
Alle singen mit. "Eo!"
Ganz laut im Chor, das geht ins Ohr
Keiner kriegt davon genug,
Alle halten mich für klug
Hoffentlich merkt keiner den Betrug!
Denn das ist alles nur geklaut
Das ist alles gar nicht meine
Das ist alles nur geklaut
Doch das weiß ich nur ganz alleine
Das ist alles nur geklaut und gestohlen
nur gezogen und geraubt
Entschuldigung, das hab ich mir erlaubt
Ich bin tierisch reich
Ich fahre einen Benz, der in der Sonne glänzt
Ich hab 'nen großen Teich
Und davor ein Schloss und ein weißes Ross
Ich bin ein großer Held
Und reise um die Welt
Ich werde immer schöner durch mein Geld
Doch das ist alles nur geklaut
Ich will gern verführen
Doch bald schon merke ich
Das wird nicht gleicht für mich
Ich geh mit dir spazieren
Und spreche ein Gedicht in dein Gesicht
Ich sag:"Ich schrieb es nur für dich!"
Und dann küsst du mich
Denn zu meinem Glück weißt du nicht作曲 : Athanasios Toutziaridis

 Ihr braucht Salus für Gesundheit, Ares für die Kriege
 Loki für das Feuer, Aphrodite für die Liebe
 Morpheus für die Träume, Luna für den Mond
 Hoffentlich bleib ich von Freyas Fruchtbarkeit verschont
 Ihr braucht Flora für den Frühling, Kratos für Macht
 Und Allah für all das, was keinen Spaß macht
 Pan für die Wälder, Nox für die Nacht
 Ja, all dies und noch mehr hat sich die Menschheit ausgedacht
 (Doch) Ich brauch nur einen Gott
 Einen Gott für mich
 Einen Gott der mir ergeben ist
 Und dieser Gott bin ich
 Ihr braucht Apollo für Musik und Chione für den Schnee
 Somnus für den Schlaf, für die Sonne braucht ihr Re
 Ihr braucht Gaia für die Erde, Dyonisus für Wein
 Und ohne Mitras gäb' es weder Licht noch Sonnenschein
 Ihr braucht Erebos für die Finsternis, Poseidon für das Meer
 Und ohne Zeus und Odin wär' das Reich der Götter leer
 Thor für den Donner, Hades für die Toten
 Und dann wär' da noch der eine Gott für eu're Sünden

And they say we're born to loose
You're the misfit
I'm the sinner
You're the heathen
I'm the fool
But today you'll be the master
Or the slave it's up to you
Oh my beautiful disaster
Take me anyway you choose
Don't fight it
Ignite it
There's much sure
I think it's time you set this world on fire (this world on fire)
I think it's time you push it to the edge (to the edge)
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire (just trip the wire)
It may never be this good again, oh
It's like a new religion
Speak in tongues, come see the light
Do not trip from inhibitions that will only waste my time
Let me tempt you with the evils of the flesh and so much more
Like a Babylon redeemer
Like a pusher, like a whore
Just try it, you'll like it
I'll give you more
I think it's time you set this world on fire (this world on fire)
I think it's time you push it to the edge (to the edge)
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire (just trip the wire)
It may never be this good again, oh
It's so dark, I can't see
All the truth inside us
All I want is to feel something that's real before the end
Close the door
Turn the key
Do you like
What you see?
Kill the lights
Oh, come to me
Set it off tonight
Baby, just set fire to gasoline
I think it's time you set this world on fire (this world on fire)
I think it's time you push it to the edge (to the edge)
I'm so ****in' bored, so trip the wire (just trip the wire)
It may never be this good again
Just trip the wire (just trip the wire)

Breaking loose
From reality surrounding me
Keeping you
Bonded in my imagination
Drifting away
Within the limits of consciousness
Falling in sleep
With memories you left for me

Throwing all away
Meaningless words
Nothing left
Inside me

Restless dream
Stiring up in my head
Shakes up
My sweaty body from torture
Waking up
In empty room filled with dark
Asking myself
Will this reality never end?

Where are you
My wealth of life?
Vanity filling my mind
Hole in me in distress
Who will fill up
My Hollow Heart?

Ablum:They Will Return 2002

Throwing all away
Meaningless words
Nothing left
Inside me
Please god
Never let me fall asleep
Make me real
Keep away from my imagination
Dishearten mind
Still looking for another answer
Hopeless act
Action speak louder than words

Where are you
My wealth of life?
Vanity filling my mind
Hole in me in distress
Who will fill up
My Hollow Heart?

Who will fill up
My Hollow Heart?无歌词What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I ****ing told you

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out ****ing life

Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I gotta know now, you better tell me

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
"I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever"

We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out ****ing life

All out life, yeah
I challenge you to all out ****ing life, yeah

With my mind in unrest
Unsure of what may come.
What have I done to bring this down on me?
Helpless to make this undone

All in due time, see the world through different eyes.
All in due time, the shadows will give way to light.

How much more can I give of myself,
as these walls close in on me?
As I slip down into this despair
into this despair
There is nothing to attain

What victory

When my soul is weak,

All in due time, see the world through different eyes.
I see the world through different eyes.
All in due time, shadows will give way, give way to light.

All that we suffer through leads to determination.
The trials we all go through gives us the strength to carry on.
Something within us burns, desire feeds the will to live.
A reason to believe I will see redemption.

I can't get laid in Germany!无歌词作词 : DOWNING, KENNETH/HALFORD, ROBERT/TIPTON, GLEN
Dark thoughts rise up
Deep in your mind
The killing of hope
The end has begun
The locked psycho-door breaks down
The beast breathes freedom and fire
Blows bloody thoughts into your mind

Demons whisper: ＂COMMIT SUICIDE!＂

Weak is your body,
Helpless your soul,

The beast destroyed your will

Left nothing but an empty shell

Self-destruction leads its way
Your weapons turn against yourself
Cutting through, killing you
A downward spiral, the shadowbeast has won

The shadowbeast calls
A vulture of life

Your worst enemy dwells
From within无歌词I will be the end of your ****ing existence
Witness my rebirth
I have descended to take all control
Separate the weak minded to become cattle
And host for my children
I have returned to sterilize the human disease
And I'll take what is mine
I will take your mind
Behold the true architect
An artificial saviour has carried your burdens
Your minds and your gods are my design
I created your technology
I engineered your way of life
I am beyond understanding
I am infinite
The harvested minds will fuel the next cycle
I have come to impose my will
I am the key, I am the answer
You exist only because I allow it
I am extinction
I have laid dormant for thousand of years
Awoken only to swallow your cities whole
Humans are not the first
I have extinguished
They will not be the last
Entire civilizations devoured
Relinquish your self control
Relinquish control
Behold the true architect
An artificial saviour has carried your burdens
I am the beginning
I am the end
I am what you can't find words for
I am beyond all understanding
Witness my rebirth
I am infinite
I will be the end of everything you know
Your minds and your gods are my design
I will be the end of everything you know
Your minds and your gods are my design
I will be the end of everything you know
Your minds and your gods are my design
I will be the end of everything you know
Your minds and your gods are my designAre you so narrow minded that you never stopped to think

Two steps past this fleeting moment or what a life could mean?
And you can't stand the thought that you were wrong
Blaming all those who were never at fault
Take a step aside and tiptoe past lines
So rehearsed to convince yourself you are fine
If there was even a chance could you still bring yourself to turn away
Cold feet dripping ice into your veins
Is it second nature just to throw a guiltless life aside?
You built yourself up, the pain still burns in your eyes

Where are you now? Was this not your home?
Guess I'll step up and be the man that you never were
Can you stand to look in the mirror?
Where are you now? Are you alone?
You said you'd never leave
Tell me was it easy

So you mean to say that I only got in the way
Of your plans and dreams, your selfish schemes?
You took this life for granted but it was never yours to take
Point to the possibility of everything you took from me
I hope you know how it feels to be alone

You'll know what it is to be alone
Can you live with the mistakes you've made?
Does it sting to think I'll never know your name?
You're to blame

Where are you now? Was this not your home?
Guess I'll step up and be the man that you never were
Can you stand to look in the mirror?
Where are you now? Are you alone?
You said you'd never leave
Tell me was it easy

Where are you now? How long has it been
Since you have heard my name?
And how long will you treat this like a game?
Where are you now and what will it take
For it to go my way? There's gotta be a better way

A better way
It's not your voice I'm looking for now
And these halls I pass never meant much with you around
I'm becoming something that you never will
Stop and take a look around
This ship's not going down

But you're not around
You never even said goodbye

Where are you now? Was this not your home?
Guess I'll step up and be the man that you never were
Can you stand to look in the mirror?
Where are you now? Are you alone?
You said you'd never leave
Tell me was it easyIn the eyes of the trapper fire's burning, burning bright
He's searching for the crossing where the fox has left its traces on
Shortly finds a trail jam, lays his snare under the trace
With care wipes his own marks and skis back along his own tracks

The work has been done as well as he does
Can't sleep at night, can't stand the wait
He has to get up, he has to leave
And before the dawn the chase is on

Gently slide the skis on the hardened skiing tracks
The narrow beam of the headlight moves around back and forth
Shows the way through the tangle, reveals the gleam under the spruce
The yellow flashes in the darkness, shotgun's flame lights up the sky

The gleam dies out
But the fire's burning

And on the gambrel's nails
Is hanging upside down
One of god's cereals
Giving away its skin and tail

Once and again
This lonely man
Is skiing back
Along his own tracks作曲 : James Hetfield/Lars Ulrich

Nein, dir bedeutet all das nichts mehr
Nicht der Abend, nicht der Fluss
Am wenigsten vielleicht die Momente
Die ein letztes Mal an uns vorüberzieh'n

Was heute noch nach Herbst riecht
Wird morgen schon vergangen sein
Und dein Parfüm an mir hält sicher
Nicht einmal so lang
Kaum zu glauben
Dass dies nun schon die letzte Stunde ist
Mit jemandem
Der gar nicht mehr lebt

Doch wie wir hier nur stehen und atmen
Scheint sich fast nichts verändert zu haben

Von hier aus, wo wir warten
Sieht man uns're Lichtung
Und ich kann nicht sagen, ob du dich wohl
Irgendwann noch mal daran erinnern wirst

Doch wie wir hier nur stehen und atmen
Scheint sich fast nichts verändert zu haben

Und beinahe golden
Scheint der Sommer zu sterben
Gestorben zu seinLove is a Liar's Game

Come on over, little closer
Come on baby put your head up on my shoulder
So I told her, it was over
Don't you worry everything's just like I told you
Give it time and you will see
You're the only one that's right for me so,
Let me hold you tight, just for one more night
Just one more night

Love is a liar's game, so try your shame
Nobody wins when it's over
Love is a hopeless case, a nameless face
With every touch growing colder

Listen up baby this is what I'll do
I'm doing everything I can to make it up to you
You're the only one who cares, every memory shared
Looking up at the heavens, will you take me there?

You're, you're the only one that's right for me
You're the only one I'll ever need, you're next to me
You're next to me

Love is a liar's game, so try your shame
Nobody wins when it's over
Love is a hopeless case, a nameless face
With every touch growing colder

Got caught up in a hurricane
There's nothing left to feed the flame
Wont ever be the same
I'm running out of ways to say

Got caught up in a hurricane
There's nothing left to feed the flame
Wont ever be the same
I'm running out of ways to say goodbye

I never meant a word of it anyway
**** you, bitch

Live with this forever
Bury yourself with the lies you told

Love is a liar's game so try your shame
Nobody wins when it's over
Love is a hopeless case, a nameless face
With every touch growing colder
Touch growing colder
Touch growing colder﻿Change! It's all I need
Cause I can not figure me out

Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love
First forgiveness
We were delinquents
Freaks of a faded memory

Outlaws, When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption
Baby Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
The outlaws of forever

Scars, broken hearts
Breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls
Bottle rockets
All that we wanted
Is for a life beyond the stars

Outlaws, When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption
Baby Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby

I got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirits
Race around with my innocence
I'll plead my innocence
But that's my best defense
When you are young

Outlaws, When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption
Baby Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
The outlaws of forever

I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train and you can't go back
Forever now
Forever now, you'll roamDesperate cry of a child
Who only wants to live
An innocent human being
Deprived of all his dreams
Painful faces of the others
Who once were the chosen
Innocent eyes of the child
Never going to see
The voice of crystal children
Of deaf ears it has fallen
And the preacher delivers a sermon
But who's ready for salvation
Remembrance behind the scene
Of unjustice and injustice
In the forsaken faces
Expression of frustration
The voice of crystal children
Of deaf ears it has fallen
And the preacher delivers a sermon
But who's ready for salvationDry up the sea,
with a word turn it all to desert sand
Turn all the lights out in the sky,
blot out all the stars
Make your presence unmistakable
and watch the devil flee
That old serpent that slipped through the cracks,
exiled back to the sea
So carry me to the foot of the throne room
or hide me in the ground
So bring me the head of the beast
or hide me in the ground
Wake up your hearts
The dead come to rise
No longer apart
Your bodies will rise
Let all those who dwelt in dust
be born in the light of the guilt you crush
Wake up your hearts
The dead come to rise
No longer apart
Your bodies will rise
Let all those who dwelt in dust
be born in the light of the guilt you crush
The Earth resonates with your voice
Shaking the woodwork
WIth one swing the pride of a hopeless nation will fall down
Bring me the head of the beast
or hide me in the ground
Wake up your hearts
The dead come to rise
No longer apart
Your bodies will rise
Let all those who dwelt in dust
be born in the light of the guilt you crush
Wake up your hearts
The dead come to rise
No longer apart
Your bodies will rise
Let all those who dwelt in dust
be born in the light of the guilt you crush
When we meet face to face
The world and the depths will separate
So bring me the head of the beast
or hide me in the ground
Bury me
Bury me
I'd rather die than just sit back and watch you hurt
Tired brothers, loving sisters,
To all those who have had enough;
Your fight isn't over, you're going to press on
To a loveless generation
born to be an impending resurgence:
Let all those who dwelt in dust
be born in the light of the guilt you crushSay goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Goodbye to the ones that we love

Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love

Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
Oh lord have mercy on my soul
Kindred spirits sing
For the sick and suffering (the suffering)
The city of damage control
This is how we roll

Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol

From the bottom of the well
Oh lord have mercy on my soul
Hear the children sing
For the sick and suffering (the suffering)
The city of damage control
This is how we roll

I've spent all night long trying to figure out
What I've lost and what I've failed
When my feet won't hit the ground
Trying to make it, soaring over
And will we ever love again?
Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late
So here we are again, to make some since of it all
All these story changes, maybe tonight's no different
Rearrange the pieces, like it's all we know
It's all we know, let it go
Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late
I can't put it together, what we've lost
The pieces keep falling one by one
Cause this life is us holding on
Fall tomorrow then it's gone
Fall tomorrow then I'm gone
Hey baby, it looks like you were wrong
How can we make it?
Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late
(Take it all, leave the place behind)
There's no on else tonight
Tonight
(Take it all, leave the place behind)
There's no on else tonight
TonightAm I Still afraid?
Frustrating those around me
This mind is a constant race
This mind is a constant ****ing mess
Never slowing down, never ****ing calm
A race that never ends
And I am sorry, but I will never slow things down.
It's just the way that I know how
To keep me one step ahead of the crowd
And I am sorry, that I left you behind
But I can't slow down
The years have passed so fast, I'm still never slowing down
Never take anything you have for granted
Frustrating those around me
Never slowing down (never slowing down)
And never ****ing calm
And I am sorry, but I will never slow things down.
It's just the way that I know how
To keep me one step ahead of the crowd
And I am sorry, that I left you behind
But I can't slow down (No I can't slow down)
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
I've been a danger to myself
I've been a danger to myself
I've been a danger to myself

in the good of every heart
No matter what the world
may perceive as "truth"
How do we know which road to take
when temptation leads the way
Follow our virtue
Where it will lead us
As the story goes
Shrouded in mystery
Fate bestowing down upon me strength to carry through
Scarlet, hear me now
This is my vow to you
Light will shed hope on our forsaken souls
Though every sign is pointing me away
the question still remains
Are they visions that you see
in panic and uncertainty?
Another voice is telling me to stay
Have faith inside of you
Don't run from the reality
that stands before you
Give me the wisdom to unravel every tangled thread
running within my every vein
Save me from silence drowning me inside of my head
before the remedy is forever lost again
As the story goes
Fallen in history
Heaven shining down upon the courage to pursue
Scarlet, hear me now
This is my vow to you
Night will soon end on our forsaken souls
The symptoms pounding as I bleed
(Divinity, have mercy on a bended knee)（
I take the challenge to defeat now
(Loyalty, I salute thee as I beg and plead)（
Rebellion calling, take the lead
(Divinity, have mercy on a bended knee)（
I stand my ground, do not retreat now
(Loyalty, I salute thee as I beg and plead)（
As the story goes
Shrouded in mystery
Fate bestowing down upon me strength to carry through

This is my vow to you
Light will shed hope on our forsaken souls

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean
Gotta get away
Holy Diver
Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in a blackened room
Something is coming for you
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away-get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel
Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen
Repeat verse 1作词 : Laiho
Hight above yer shadow smiles at me.
Way down below I hear your serenely breathe.
I'm running after you throughout
the valleys of tormented souls,
don't you be afraid of me only kissing your shadows...
You're so far away, I can your scent,
when I carries your shadow,
and if you truly want I'll cross the line I'll follow.
I'm dreaming my way out from down below.
To get wherever you haunting from, I'll go...
I'm kissing the shadows you surround me with,
to feel my pain vanishing away from me.
Your touching the shadows I'm surrounding you with,
so together in pease we shall be.
I'm running after you throughout
the valleys of tormented souls,
don't you be afraid of me only kissing your shadows...
You're so far away, I can your scent,
when I carries your shadow,
and if you truly want I'll cross the line I'll follow.Walk in my shoes,
A mile of abuse
I can't remember the things I do
Not what I seem,
Not what I dream
Shed all my skin,
I wanna wash it clean
And maybe it's calling you
But it brings back the pain,
It brings back
Maybe it's calling you
And it's too late to turn back now
I can't erase it,
I can't replace it
Nothing I do is gonna stop the rain
I can still taste it,
Everything's wasted
Blind in the dark but I can feel the stain
It reminds me of you
It reminds me of you
I could be strong,
 I could be good
I could be something,
I know I should
Wait for the sun,
wait for a change
Wait but I know it's gonna be the same
And maybe it's calling you
But it brings back the pain,
It brings back
Maybe it's calling you
And it's too late to turn back now
I can't erase it,
 I can't replace it
Nothing I do is gonna stop the rain
I can still taste it,
Everything's wasted
Blind in the dark but I can feel the stain
It reminds me of you
It reminds me of you
This habit I haven't overcome
This weakness,
It bleeds into my bones
It's inside of me now
It's inside of me now
I can't erase it,
I can't replace it
Nothing I do is gonna stop the rain
I can still taste it,
Everything's wasted
Blind in the dark but I can feel the stain
I can't erase it,
I can't replace it
Nothing I do is gonna stop the rain
I can still taste it,
Everything's wasted
Blind in the dark but I can feel the stain
It reminds me of you
It reminds me of you
I can feel the stain
I can feel the stain
I can't erase it,
I can't replace it
Nothing I do is gonna stop the rainHear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame （Hey!）
The shame
The ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called Faith and Misery（Hey!）
And bleed, the company lost the war today
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line （Hey!）
To find, the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? （Amen!）
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men （Hey!）
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
The representative from California has the floor;
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just cause, just cause, because we're outlaws yeah!
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

This is our lives on holiday作词 : Anderson, Howe
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out and out
And spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I'll spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distant atmosphere
Call it morning driving thru the sound and even in the valley
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears we stand surrounded by a million years
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out and out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out and out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky, they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out and out
You spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you作曲 : Hanson, Howes, Winkler

Just a kid, just a fool
Always trying to play it so cool
So he did what he knew
He left home and he dropped out of school
He wanted fame, fame, fame
Even just a little bit of shame, shame, shame
He would sell his soul over in
Changed his name, never going to get it back, no
He's got money, but he's way off track
So lonely that it makes him think back
To his family and his friends and the lady he left back home
He's loaded and alone
He's loaded and alone

Still a kid, still a fool
Still trying to break all the rules
A big house, with too many rooms
An ego, to go with it too
He got his fame, fame, fame
More than just a little bit of shame, shame, shame
That he sold his soul over in
Changed his name, never going to get it back, no
He's got money, but he's way off track
So lonely that it makes him think back
To his family and his friends and the lady he left back home
He's loaded and alone

He got his fame, fame, fame
Such a shame, shame, shame
He's got money, but he's way off track
So lonely that it makes him think back
To his family and his friends and the lady he left back home
He's got money, but he's way off track
So lonely that it makes him think back
To his family and his friends and the lady he left back home
He's loaded and alone
He's loaded and alone
He wanted fame, fame, fame
And such a shame, shame, shame
He got his fame, fame, fame
Such a shame, shame, shame
Yeah,

This is your time,
Your life's flashing before your eyes.
And soon enough you will realize that this is goodbye,
but what if I gave you a chance?
You just have to sell your soul.

Look around, what do you see?
The choices you never had the guts to make?
I'm sorry you never could be the man that you wanted,
but regret is wasted on me.

I can feel air inside my lungs again.
All because of you.
I can rebuild my life and start again.

All because of you.

This feeling's amazing, I know.
But be careful, you know not what you wish for.

Granted life but now you've cheated death.
There's no where to run when you run from yourself.

But fear not for as long as you live you are mine,
and even in death you will find.

You've lived with regret for so long
but now is your chance to change what has been wrong.

I can feel air inside my lungs again.
All because of you.
I can rebuild my life and start again.
All because of you.
And I know that my destiny wasn't written in the stars,
It was just a part of satellites and it's all because of you.
Yeah, it's all because of you.

Don't ever trust the devil, bitch!

I never wanted this.

time that you suffered the
I should have know my time was up.

crave you your time, and now your soul is

I can't feel air inside my lungs.

I'm dead.
All because of...

YOU!

All because of you!

I can't feel air inside my lungs, I'm dead!

All because of you!
I can't rebuild my life and start again,

All because of you!

Arose beside Venus when night settled in; 
The eye of the heavens o'er Hastings beholds 
The Norman and the Saxon lying side by side, 
Drenched in red blood, still clinging to their swords, 
They fought for the dominion of Albion's lands. 
Yet who proved the strongest, hardly a man can tell; 
Whose God prevailed? Christ or the Old Faith? 
The days shall come, the nights shall pass 
And the grass will grow on the mounds, alas! 
The wind laments across Hastings' vale, 
It still remembers the sound of swords being crossed, 
The poignant yells the sound of fury, the fire and the blood! 
And though centuries may pass, 
And tall on Hastings grow the grass, 
Remember that terrible day of swords, 
Remember the warriors whose lives were lost -
Remember Hastings and shed a tear for it's ghost!无歌词无歌词作曲 : Jagger,Richards

I had a dream last night
That I was partying a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a
Louisiana swamp
Shot up all the zombies
But I come out on top
What's it all about?
It just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt
Aaaaall I hear is doooom and gloom
And aaaaall is darkness in my room
Through the light your face
I see Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with meeeeee
Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor
Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors
Hear a funky noise
That's the tightening of the screeeeews
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Sitting in the dirt
Aaaaall I hear is doooom and gloom
But when those drums go boom boom boom
Through the night your face
I see Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with meeee
YeahBaby won't you dance with meeee
Oh yeah
Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking
Ar the garbage dumb
I'm running out of water
So I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober
But I end up drunk
We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the roooaaad
There's some food for thought
Kind of makes your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt
YeahBut aaaall
I hear is doooom and gloom
And aaaaall is darkness in my room
Through the night your face
I seeBaby come on
Baby won't you dance with me
YeahYeahBaby won't you dance with me
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby won't you dance with meeeee
YeahCome on
I'm sitting in the dirt
Baby won't you dance with me!!作词 : Schuldiner
What pain will it take
To satisfy you
Your sick appetite
Go in for the kill
Always in sight, prey
The time always right, feast
Feed on the pain, taste
Sorrow made flesh, sweet
Live how you want
Just don't feed on me
If you doubt what I say
I will make you believe
Shallow are words
From those who starve
For a dream not their own to
Slash and scar
Big words small mind
Behind the pain you will find a scavenger
Of human sorrow

So you have traveled far
Across the sea
To spread your written brand
Of misery
Always in sight, prey
The time always right, feast
Feed on the pain, taste
Sorrow made flesh, sweet
Live how you want
Just don't feed on me
If you doubt what I say
I will make you believe
Shallow are words
From those who starve
For a dream not their own to

Dr. Feelgood

Rat-tailed Jimmy is a second hand hood
He deals out in Hollywood
Got a \'65 Chevy, primered flames
Traded for some powdered goods
Jigsaw Jimmy He\'s runnin\' a gang
But I hear he\'s doin\' o.k.
Got a cozy little job, sells the Mexican mob
Packages of candycaine
He\'s the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He\'s the one that makes ya feel alright
He\'s the one they call Dr. Feelgood

Cops on the corner always ignore
Somebody\'s getting paid
Jimmy\'s got it wired, law\'s for hire
Got it made in the shade
Got a little hideaway, does business all day
But at night he\'ll always be found
Selling sugar to the sweet
People on the street
Call this Jimmy\'s town
He\'s the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He\'s the one that makes ya feel alright
He\'s the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He\'s gonna be your Frankenstein
I\'ve got one thing you\'ll understand
He\'s not what you\'d call a glamorous man
Got one thing that\'s easily understood
He\'s the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He\'ll tell you he\'s the king
Of thes barrio streets
Moving up to shangri-la
Came by his wealth as a matter of luck
Says he never broke no law
Two time loser running out of juice
Time to move out quick
Heard a rumour going round
Jimmy\'s going down
This time it\'s gonna stick
He\'s the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He\'s the one that makes ya feel alright
He\'s the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He\'s gonna be your Frankenstein
Let him soothe your soul, just take his hand
Some people call him an evil man
Let him introduce himself real good
He\'s the only one they call \"Feelgood\"
I\'ve got one thing you\'ll understand
He\'s not what you\'d call a glamorous man
Got one thing that\'s easily understood
He\'s the one they call Dr. Feelgood作曲 : Jonne

A modern day warrior
Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride
is Though not his for mind rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve, a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river
What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist, catch the myth
Catch the mystery, catch the drift
The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep

Maybe as his skies are wide
Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets high on you
And the space he invades
He gets by on you
No his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is
What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness, catch the wit
Catch the spirit, catch the spit
The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his eyes are wide
Exit the warrior
Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets high on you
And the energy you trade
He gets right on to the friction of the dayJustified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of cover ups Where leprosy touch their flesh
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real!
See the burnished images of A crest fallen agency
Violent conditioning, caused the nature of the enemy
Your terminal lack of vision Blinded eyes see no lights
A chronic lack of perspective Their cancer now eats us alive
A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real!
Justified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
A culture made of cover ups Where leprosy touch their flesh
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real!
A fatal shot, a lust for blood

Sah ein mädchen ein röslein stehen
Blühte dort in lichten höhen
Sprach sie ihren liebsten an

Ob er es ihr steigen kann

Sie will es und so ist es fein

So war es und so wird es immer sein

Sie will es und so ist es brauch
Was sie will bekommt sie auch
Tiefe brunnen muss man graben
Wenn man klares wasser will
Rosenrot oh rosenrot
Tiefe wasser sind nicht still

Der jüngling steigt den berg mit qual

Die aussicht ist ihm sehr egal

Hat das röslein nur i'm sinn

Bringt es seiner liebsten hin

Sie will es und so ist es fein

So war es und so wird es immer sein

Sie will es und so ist es brauch

Was sie will bekommt sie auch
Tiefe brunnen muss man graben
Wenn man klares wasser will
Rosenrot oh rosenrot
Tiefe wasser sind nicht still

An seinen stiefeln bricht ein stein

Will nicht mehr am felsen sein

Und ein schrei tut jedem kund
Beide fallen in den grund

Sie will es und so ist es fein

So war es und so wird es immer sein

Sie will es und so ist es brauch
Was sie will bekommt sie auch
Tiefe brunnen muss man graben

Säg mig, vem sörjer nu för dig?
För slit och släp under himmel grå
han blott sitt bröd som löning får
Säg mig, vem sörjer nu för dig?
Så kommer hastigt budet in:
-Vår herre lägrar dotra din!
Säg mig, vem sörjer nu för dig?
Och trälen nu genom dörren steg,
han lämna plogen vid åkerns teg.
Säg mig, vem sörjer nu för dig?
-Herr lager hör nu mina ord,
min doter till din hora gjord.
Säg mig, vem lyssnar nu till dig?

-Du värnar ej om ditt trälablod.
Säg mig, vem lyssnar nu till dig?
Varken öl eller vin dig ämnat,
ej heller ägorätt
dock skula, skorpa, skalk.
Träl visste ej ett ord utav

Säg mig, vem skulle värna om dig?

Säg mig, vem skulle värna om dig?

Säg mig, vem sörjer nu för dig?
"O tack"! han sa med gråtmild röst

Age of trying to cope
(Behind December's wall)

Years and years of finding myself
This was the longest journey I've ever made
Days of wasting tears and no one cares
Countless nights drowning in worthless nightmares
Ages of trying cope ages of not giving up hope

Keeping alive the hope for a deeper sense
For a better understanding of my world
My destiny my goals and myself
Climbing out of that endless misery
No security no confirmation of an end
Alone in the masses
Alone in the masses
Alone in the masses

Is there anybody on my side
Please appear now
I feel myself slowly crumbing
And when the rain is coming I can feel myself
Melting into the ground
Becoming the puppet I never meant to be

I don't know how I don't know why
So sure I don't deserve this
But there came an eastern wind that brought me forward
Pushed me out of the sludge formed my actual self
Buried my inner demons
Looked up behind December's wall
Looked up behind December's wall

The rain can't force me anymore
I'm strong enough to hold back the storms now
Seeing my visions clean like never before
Like never before
From that day I met you

For what you are for what law in me
Now I can see clearly all the wrong paths I took
The prospect is perfect
From the road i see down the walls
(from the roof)
I am bulletproof
I am bulletproof
I am bulletproof
I am bulletproof

And if the vultures are ever circling above me again
You can be sure I won't let you go
Because i know you can still fell my passion
Strengthened by the scars I've collected
In the past
I will move haven and earth to save this
Because I'm bulletproof

BulletproofldWe will lite ourselves a flame
Lite ourselves a flame as we kiss the sky
We set the fires to take us higher
We set the fires to watch them burn
Burn
Burn
Burn Burn Burn
Let’s burn this bastard to the ground
You’re my deep obsession
I'm the sweet depression
I'm your muse
Make it burn
We are the voices that ignite the masses
Scream for me, we are free
Strength in numbers, we encumber your dominion
Rightfully, I wanna hear you scream
Mercy please
I won’t stop
Dead, or not
We are the voices that ignite the ****ing truth
We set the fires to take us higher
We set the fires to watch them burn
Burn!
Burn!
Burn Burn Burn
Let’s Burn this bastard to the ground
We set the fires to take us even higher
We set the fires to watch them ****ing burn
Burn!
Burn!
Burn Burn Burn
Let’s burn this bastard to the ground
Burn it to the ground
Cleansing all the hate of the wicked
Liberate our life from oppression
Come on
Make it burn
We set the fires to take us higher
We set the fires to watch them burn
Burn!
Burn!
Burn Burn Burn
Burn this bastard to the ground
We set the fires to take us even higher
We set the fires to watch them ****ing burn
Burn!

Let’s burn this bastard to the ground
We will lite ourselves a flame
Lite ourselves a flame, as we kiss the sky(Adesso sono qui...)
An old dungeon hidden from all the light
Thirteen candles enlighten the dark
Shadows are playing their games on the wall
And a shimmering glow fills the arch
Now, as night steps aside, and a new dawn will break
Silently a new age of science awakes
Old theory that has been wrong
Power of the universe
Will take me to the place where I belong
Through the clouds of lies and fear
In silent moments it comes near:
In my deepest hour of darkness
They will shine...(feel my scorn) endlessly…
splenderanno.
(The sword that killed the unicorn)
Callisto, Europa
(Adesso sono qui...)
Now, as night steps aside, and a new dawn will break
Silently a new age of science awakes
Splenderanno... per aspera ad astra
His theories and knowledge
Mean danger in these times
And those accused of heresy
Will not longer be alive
Hide, hide your secrets well
For in your darkest hour you should dwell
(Adesso sono qui...)
An old table covered with parchments and rolls
The great one has children of four
Callisto, Europa, Ganymed e Io
The bright universe to adore
Old theory that has been wrong
Power of the universe
Will take me to the place where I belong
Through the clouds of lies and fear
In silent moments it comes near:
In my deepest hour of darkness
They will shine...(feel my scorn) endlessly…
splenderanno.

The only mother we have left
She is the web in the willow hoop
Like feathers, we just hang in the air
Open arms to a mother's gift
Electric sensations pulsating through our ribs
Breathing life into our dreams
Wear down the dancing lines
Of her woven web
Hanging beneath the nightmare we fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names
Sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you we fall apart
We fall apart
Restore youth
Ghost of the willow trees
The oak, the pines
Are bowing mountain peaks
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
Open arms to a mother's gift
Electric sensations pulsating through our ribs
Breathing life into our dreams
The weight of man is crushing me
The weight of man is crushing me
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
From looming pines through ocean seas
Oh Mother, I am breaking down
Oh Mother, I call to you
Ghost of the willows
The weight of man is crushing me
I am falling apart
Broken into someone less than who I'm meant to be
I am lost
I am lost
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
From looming pines through the ocean seas
Breathe life into these stagnant feet
Restore the man that I'm meant to be
Hanging beneath the nightmare we fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names
Sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you (we fall apart
We fall apart
Restore youth
Hanging beneath the nightmare we fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names
Sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you (we fall apart
We fall apart
Restore youth无歌词作曲 : Sjunnesson, Sjunnesson
The walls are moving closer, now
Can you feel it, can you feel it?
You are not saved until you see the dawn
Set my Eden on fire, now
You did it, you did it
Smoked out my soul once and for all
I'm coming home tonight
Can we make it right?
Or twist the dagger in my back
You lit the fires in me that I never thought I had
Now it's nothing but a memory....
BE PATIENT; SOMEDAY,
THIS PAIN WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU
BE PATIENT; SOMEDAY,
THIS PAIN WILL SETTLE DEEP IN YOU
The helix is shattered, now

You broke it, you broke it
The destruction of my entire essence
Drink the nectars of the shadow flower, now
Contaminated
And sit back as it reaches for your heart
Deep in you...
BE PATIENT SOMEDAY
THIS PAIN WILL BE USEFUL USEFUL TO YOU！
BE PATIENT SOMEDAY
 THIS PAIN WILL SETTLE DEEP IN DEEP IN YOU！
In the excavation of my human heart,
I found something
Something that I never knew existed无歌词You ready?!
Lets go!
Yeah,
for those of you that want to know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon!)
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But **** em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Makin the story - makin sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin it up! let's go!
Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin from writin raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin his way to the top
People think its a common owners name
People keep askin him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No he's livin proof, Got him rockin the booth
He'll get you buzzin quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doin give a hundred percent
Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those mother****ers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?!
Eight years in the makin, patiently waitin to blow
Now the record with the Virgins takin over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!Reflektionen

Und als der Abend grau um grau
In diese seichte Szene dringt
Steh' ich allein auf den Veranden
Mit dem Glas eiskalt in meiner Hand

Den trüben Blick hinab
In die Gärten naher Nacht
Und in des Windes Spielen
Von den fahlen Phrasen fortgesonnen
Wie weh'n Visionen durch die Stille
Der Schatten schimmerhafte Schemen
Wecken jene Träume alter Zeit
Noch lange nicht verblasst genug

Goldkristall'ne Reflexionen
Warmer Lichter einer Welt
Die noch zu viel des Lebens birgt
Das du ihr einst gebracht

Leisen Liedern lausche ich
Die noch erzähl'n von Sommerseligkeit
In Versen unser beider Worte
All das ist lange schon vorbei
Wie weh'n Visionen durch die Stille
Der Schatten schimmerhafte Schemen
Wecken jene Träume alter Zeit
Noch lange nicht verblasst genug

Ich geb' mich hin dem teuren Trug
Nur diese eine Nacht
Ja, vielleicht nur diese
Nur diese eine Nacht

So fortzuleben ist der Tod
Entfliehen wir noch heute Nacht
Und träumen nur vom Morgenrot
Auf immerdar.Un jour je me réveillerai,
Les yeux noirs couleur bitume
Et je pleurerai des larmes de goudron
Les poumons noirs, le cœur engourdi
Comme un oiseau loin de son nid
L'air pur me manque,
Le bruit des gens autour m'angoisse
La ville s'immisce peu à peu
Dans ce corps maigre qu'est le mien
Obstruant ainsi mes rêveries joyeuses
D'un idéal qui s'éteint
Sais-tu de quoi j'ai envie?
De partir vivre dans les montagnes,
Entouré de hauts sapins
Je m'allongerai sur la mousse
Sentirai l'odeur des champignons,
Des fleurs et de la terre humideDéchire la peau épaisse
Qui pèse sur mes épaules
Détache-la pour moi
Membre par membre
Pièce par pièce
Je veux te montrer qui je suis
Au delà de mon corps
Au delà de ma chair
Te laisser entrevoir
Mes éclats limpides
Non humains
Regarde-moi
Tel que je suis
Et accepte-moi
Ne les laisse pas
Me voler mon ame
Ne les laisse pas la ternir
Regarde-moi
Tel que je suis
Et accepte-moi
Ne les laisse pas
Me voler mon ame
Ne les laisse pas la ternir作曲 : Daniel Erlandsson/Michael Amott

There's blood in the water
There's fear in the air
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
And we're all running scared!
Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust while bombs never rust
Watch the war on your screen
Yesterday's deals were just a dream
There's blood in the water
Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

There's profit in prophets
Too much money in lies
Missiles fueled by hatred
As the blind lead the blind!
Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Have we finally run out of road?
You can't build a wall high enough
Can't dig a deep enough hole

Equality, now a profanity
Wave goodbye to humanity
There's a monster under your bed
You created it so don't be scared
Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Have we finally run out of road?
You can't build a wall high enough
Can't dig a deep enough hole

There's blood in the water
There's fear in the air
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
And we're all running scared!

There's blood in the water
An eye for an eye...
There's blood in the water

Inside my prison cell
Looking back at my life
My bones they feel so cold
While all the blood is drying out in my veins
These walls these walls are closing in

My chains they are unseen
My heart is covered with scars of betrayal

Hopeless how can I live
When I'm already dead
Scared of being alone
Can't reach the surface
I will drown again
I'm breathing the last breath
I'm taking the last step to the edge
My days are numbered
My time has come

I'm running out out of time
In these days I will retrace my memories
I'm grieving again
Till the end I cannot hide
All the things that
Drag me closer to the edge

Step to go

I am a lifeless shell
Hours pass like days
My flesh is growing old
Through all the years
I've seen my world disappear

I'm running out out of time
In these days I will retrace my memories
I'm grieving again
Till the end I cannot hide
All the things that
Drag me closer to the edge

Trapped in a cage of unrest there's no

Redeem
Trapped in a cage of unrest

There's no there's no redeem

Prisoned and isolated

Silenced silenced my screams

I'm breathing the last breath
I'm taking the last step to the edge
My days are numbered

I'm running out out of time
In these days I will retrace my memories

I'm grieving again
Till the end I cannot hide
All the things that
Drag me closer to the edge无歌词作曲 : rookiez is punk'd
泣き出しそうな表情(かお)で憂う低い空
する事もなく時間(とき)を削る
吐き出す場のない思いを飲み込んで
苛立ち混じりの唾を吐く

何もかもが 壊れそうな
不安抱いて 明日に怯え
明後日ばっか見てたって
答えは出ないことだってわかってる

限りなく広がる 真っ白な 明日に何を描く
現実が染め行く 真っ暗な 明日に何を描く
もがき輝く

悩んでる自分がなんかダサくて
じっとしてらんなくてバックレ
やりたい事そんなもんないぜ
屋上でこっそりくわえるマイセン
なんか楽しくねぇ今日のサイゼ
心配そうな目でみてるマイメン
「泣いてないぜ」なんて吐いて
強がってみてもマジ辛いぜ
通いなれた薄暗い道路
やっとの思い、買ったiPod
上辺だけの薄いラップ
何故か重い薄っぺらのバッグ
優しく暖かいはずの場所
重苦しくて明け放つ窓
重圧に押しつぶされそうで
逃げ込んだいつもの公園

何もかもが 壊れそうな
不安抱いて明日に怯え
明後日ばっか見てたって
答えは出ないことだって わかってる

限りなく広がる 真っ白な 明日に何を描く
現実が染め行く 真っ暗な 明日に何を描く

限りある僅かな時の中
ヘタクソな自分描け
今はまだそれでいい

限りなく広がる 真っ白な 明日に何を描く

もがき輝く无歌词Hörst du meine Lieder nicht, was in ihnen spricht
Wenn du weißt, was ich fühle, dann vertraue mir
Ich bin ein Freund für dich
Ich lasse dich nie im Stich
Bist wie der Abendstern
So weit entfernt
Doch ich folge dir denn in diesem Dunkel erleuchtest du mich
Ich weiß
Dass es so ist
Denn wenn ich an dich denke
Meine Zeit dir schenke
Weiß ich, was ich will bist du
Auch wenn du mir nicht viel von dir erzählst
Gibt es nichts an dir das fehlt
Alle deine Sorgen
Bleiben mir verborgen
Mit einem Lächeln, das verzeiht
Begegnest du meinem fragenden Blick
Und ich folge dir blind
In dein Licht
Hörst du meine Lieder nicht, was in ihnen spricht
Wenn ich in deine Augen seh, verlier ich mich
Ich könnt dir Stunden zuhören
Obwohl dein Mund nicht spricht
Bist wie der Abendstern
So weit entfernt
Neben dir erlischt jedes andere Licht
Du bist, was ich begehr
Mit jeder Geste, mit der du dich entfernst
Denn wenn ich an dich denke
Meine Zeit dir schenke
Weiß ich, was ich will bist du
Auch wenn du mir nicht viel von dir erzählst
Gibt es nichts an dir das fehlt
Alle deine Sorgen
Bleiben mir verborgen
Mit einem Lächeln, das verzeiht
Begegnest du meinem fragenden Blick
Und ich folge dir in dein Licht
Denn wenn ich an dich denke
Meine Zeit dir schenke
Weiß ich, was ich will bist du
Auch wenn du mir nicht viel von dir erzählst
Gibt es nichts an dir das fehlt
Alle deine Sorgen
Bleiben mir verborgen
Mit einem Lächeln, das verzeiht
Begegnest du meinem fragenden Blick
Und ich folge dir blind
In dein Licht
In dein Licht
Hörst du meine Lieder nicht
In dein Licht
Was in ihnen spricht
Bist wie der Abendstern
So weit entfernt
So weit entferntWhen your heart gives out and your love collapses
When the hand that never lets go is there no more
When you reap and sow only throe and resentment
When there's no one else but you to blame it for
When all you ever wish for is to go back once more
When all you ever wish for is to change it all
When all you feel is remorse, pain and regret
When you dwell in the past unable to move on

And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Build a wall of glass thick and deep
We hear but choose not to listen
And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Still the bridge is enflamed with fire
Leave all the love we had behind

When you realize that your life is a one-way road
When you realize that there's no point of return
When you understand that you can't go back anymore
When you understand you can only move onwards

And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Build a wall of glass thick and deep
We hear but choose not to listen
And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Still the bridge is enflamed with fire
Leave all the love we had behind

Slow down
We need to slow down
We need to slow down so I can catch you

We need to slow down so I can catch you
We need to slow down so you can catch me
We need to slow down so I can catch you
We need to slow down so you can catch me
Slow downStep aside,let us rise
Without fear into the storm
You've been out of place time
Since the day when you were born

You are forced into wheel
The soundless wheel cannot see
Let me be the one to
Guide you far from that life
Too long you have been living in sin
Wasting what you have and what you could
Now the storm’s coming，well!
Let’s go face the rain!
Just let them know
I'm gonna be here
I got answers and noting to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own beliefs，I don't need yours
I’m gonna stay the course

Let’s sway and pray
In the name of the storm
It's all the same，part of the game
Where you and I are pawns
Suddenly the clouds appear
The colour shades are green
What's a lightning like this time
When everything’s surreal?

Just let them know
I'm gonna be here
I got answers and noting to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own beliefs，I don't need yours
Just let them know
I'm gonna be here
I got answers and noting to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own beliefs，I don't need yours
I’m gonna stay the courseIt isn't easy when the world turns the back on you
I am the fire burning down this cigarette
Honestly I never really thought you'd make it this far
This was all on me, and I can't take it back
You made me feel like I could take your world away
But your words didn't mean a thing to me
In time I know I'll reach at the end of us again
Bring back my life
Retrace my steps
Full speed ahead, don't back this out
This was all on you, and you can't take it back
The secrets out and all I hear
Is the fire burning down our bridges
Still I carry you home through the fire and the flames
If you need me there you know I will be
Can you honestly say that I, I was the only one
You think your filthy words seem to realise
That I was lost at the end of all your options
When you were always on the top of my priorities
This was all on us, and we can't take it back
The secrets out and all I hear
Is the fire burning down our bridges
Still I carry you home through the fire and the flames
If you need me there you know I will be
I can always speak for myself in this
But I won't regret not saying what I needed to say
I ****ing miss you
I am on my knees
I am on my knees
The secrets out and all I hear
Is the fire burning down our bridges
Still I carry you home through the fire and the flames
If you need me there you know I will be
It doesn't matter if our bridges are burning, our bridges are burning
Cause if you need me there you know I will be作曲 : Jeffrey Ling/Benjamin Gordon/Luke Kilpatrick/Winston McCall

A system of complete control the pressure builds

It wraps its hands around your throat a constant battle

A silent war of mind and soul

Get up get up one life one shot give it all you got
Get up get up

Keep the flame alive

Hope for the hopeless a light in the darkness

Hope for the hopeless a light in a light in the dark

The chains set to break your soul day by day

You know the choice you have to make

Freeze up and fade

Or be the flame that lights the way

Get up get up one life one shot give it all you got

Get up get up

Keep the flame alive

Hope for the hopeless a light in the darkness

Hope for the hopeless you've got one life one shot

Opaque walls around me.
Am I searching for something
That was never there?
Wash the conscience of responsibility.
Move colour across the glass, intoxicate.
Break down the game,
Intentions turn to grey.
Move colour across the glass, intoxicate.
Break down the game,
Intentions turn to grey.
Save me from myself,
Give me something to blame.
Consume to the point I am not held accountable.
It was not of me if my thoughts were irrational.
And so we play the game,
Give me something, something to blame!
Wash the conscience of responsibility,
And I'll fit in with my own duplicity.
Move colour across the glass, intoxicate.
Break down the game,
Intentions turn to grey.
Move colour across the glass, intoxicate.
Break down the game,
Intentions turn to grey.
Move colour across the glass, intoxicate.
Break down the game,
Intentions turn to grey.
Move colour across the glass, intoxicate.
Break down the game,
Intentions turn to grey.
Break down the game,
Intentions turn to grey.作曲 : Eisbrecher

Ich bin nicht blind doch kann nicht sehn
Bin wie gelähmt und kann nicht gehn
Ich habe Angst und dreh mich um
Ich möchte schrein doch bleib ich stumm
Ich bin nicht müde und nicht wach
Möchte aufstehn bin zu schwach
Sehn mich im letzten Augenblick zu dir zurück...
Kannst du die Engel sehn?
Sie werden fallen nur für dich
Kannst du die Engel sehn?
Ich hol sie nur für dich...
Für dich vom Himmel!
Ich bin mir fremd, fühl mich allein
Ich lauf mir nach, hol mich nicht ein
Noch bin ich hier wer weiß wie lang
Doch was nicht endet füngt nie an
Ich bin gefangen, kann nicht fliehn
Mich meiner ohnmacht nicht entziehn
Sehn mich im letzten Augenblick zu dir zurück...
Kannst du die Engel sehn?
Sie werden fallen nur für dich
Kannst du die Engel sehn?
Ich will sie nur für dich...
Für dich vom Himmel holn!

And now it's finally the time
To leave it all behind
New era has begun
We've double checked our guns
And now it's right time for you
To make our dreams come true
Come on
We Own the night
As daylight dies
We Own the night!
Flash, strobe and smoke
That's our scenery's theme
Our intro is getting through
Let's get it started
We play our tune
People go crazy in pits
We've just started our show
Let there be rock and roll
We Own the night
As daylight dies
We Own the night
We Own the nightSome like beautiful, perfect, and pretty
I see the good in the bad and the ugly
I need the volume one louder than ten
Put the pedal to the metal, needle into the red
If the windows ain t shaking
Making my heart race
If I can t feel it in my chest
I m in the wrong damn place
Got a demon in my soul
And a voice in my head
Saying go, go, go
I can sleep when I m dead
There s a sonic revelation bringing me to my knees
And there s a man down below that needs my sympathy
I got a ringing in my ears getting ready to burst
Screaming hallelujah mother ****er take me to church
I like it louder than the boom of a big bass drum
I need it harder than the sound of guitar grunge
I like to crank it up, make it thump, all needles to the core
Head banging in the pit and throwing my horns
And just like old school Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Lemmy
I need to drop it down low and make it heavy
I like it heavy

Whoa
I like it heavy
Whoa
I ride the lightning, roll with the thunder
Going down, down, down with my sisters and brothers
I fell in love with the darkest parts
Standing on the side of the wild at heart
I plucked a feather off a crow
So I could fly
Since I was 13 years old
I ve had my horns to the sky
I like it louder than the boom of a big bass drum
I need it harder than the sound of guitar grunge
I like to crank it up, make it thump, all needles to the core
Head banging in the pit and throwing my horns
And just like old school Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Lemmy
I need to drop it down low and make it heavy
I like it heavy
Whoa
I like it heavy
Whoa
I like it, I like it, I like it heavy
I like it, I like it, I like it heavy
I like it, I like it, I like it heavy
I like it, I like it, I like it heavy

Some like beautiful perfect and pretty
I see the good in the bad and the ugly

I like it heavy

Whoa
I like it heavy
Whoa
I like it, I like it, I like it heavy
I like it, I like it, I like it heavy
I like it, I like it, I like it heavy
I like it, I like it, I like it like it heavyBehold, he stands before you all
Upon the tower, fit to fall
See the beauty of the never-ending
Hear his creatures call
Say then, say then:
Lay no eye upon my eye, lay no voice upon my crying
Set no truth above my lie, shed no tear upon my dying
An orphan is your child to be
And like you took my child from me
The likes of this, my vengeance
Jave my hell bred creatures yet to see
I've never known such naked pain
As if I'm naked in the rain
I've searched each world for virgin soil
Fit for my slaughtered child's remains

Say then, say then:
For an eye you take an eye, take my voice for all your crying
Upon your infants grave I lie, upon it's death I do my dying
For his eye you take an eye, shattered was he when we found him
Stone and cut and crucify, leave his killer's heart unpounding
Men and angels hide in vain
For he who hath my firstborn slain
Shall die before the sun has set
He took my child, he will regret

Say then, say then:
Lay no eye upon my eye, lay no voice upon my crying
Set no truth above my lie, shed no tear upon my dying

Poised the strike in the slumberous sword
Of the dark and childless lord
"This machete of mine will get thee in time “
We're alone in a room with no door"
Yes, I recall the death of one
Older and more holy son
I see the irony, but that won't render
This one deed undone
Say then, say then:
For his eye you paid an eye, a law you find is self-fulfilling
In your place your child did die
Death is all you gain from killing
Death is all you gain from killing
Death is all you gain from killingMidnight gettin' uptight where are you

You said you'd meet me now it's quarter to two

I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you
Hey Jack it's a fact they're talkin' in town

I turn my back and you're messin' around

I'm not really jealous don't like lookin' like a clown

I think of you ev'ry night and day

You took my heart then you took my pride away
I hate myself for loving you
I can't break free from the things that you do

I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Yeah

Daylight spent the night without you

But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do

I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through
Hey man bet you can treat me right

You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see you begging say forget it just for spite
I think of you ev'ry night and day

You took my heart and you took my pride away
I hate myself for loving you
I can't break free from the things that you do

I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow

I think of you ev'ry night and day

You took my heart and you took my pride away
I hate myself for loving you
I can't break free from the things that you do

I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
I hate myself for loving you

I can't break free from the things that you do

I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you

For loving you

For loving you

I hate myself

I hate myself for loving youI've been a mess since you stayed,
I've been a wreck since you changed,
Don't let me get in your way,
I miss the lies and the pain,
The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake
I am tellin' you!
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me,
I miss the screaming, the way that you blame me!
Miss the phone calls, when it's your fault,
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all!
I like the kick in the face,
And the things you do to me!
I love the way that it hurts!
I don't miss you, I miss the misery!
I've tried but I just can't take it,
I'd rather fight than just fake it
（'Cause I like it rough）,
You know that I've had enough,
I dare ya to call my bluff,
Can't take too much of a good thing
I am tellin' you!
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me,
I miss the screaming, the way that you blame me!
Miss the phone calls, when it's your fault,
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all!
I like the kick in the face,
And the things you do to me!
I love the way that it hurts!
I don't miss you, I miss the misery!
Just know that I'll make you hurt,
（I miss the lies and the pain what you did to me）
When you tell me you'll make it worse
（I'd rather fight all night than watch the TV）
I hate that feelin' inside
You tell me how hard you'll try
But when we're at our worst
I miss the misery
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me,
I miss the screaming, the way that you blame me.
I miss the rough sex, leaves me a mess,
I miss the feeling of pains in my chest!
Miss the phone calls, when it's your fault,
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all!
I like the kick in the face,
And the things you do to me!
I love the way that it hurts!
I don't miss you, I miss the misery!
I don't miss you, I Miss The Misery!!!
I don't miss you, I miss the misery!Ah,Ah （x2）
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs FLOW
Hammer of the Gods
will drive our ships to new land
to fight the horde
sing and cry
Valhalla I am coming
On we sweep with,
Threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

AH,AH （x2）
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs FLOW
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed
The tides of war
We are your Overlords
On we sweep with,
Threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruin
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losin

Master' masterIt had already become day
as he opened the big wooden door
and stepped out of the shadows.
The sun had shown behind the eastern forest,
bright and warm in a cloudless sky.
As his eyes closed, he slowly raised his head.
Gently, the morning wind caressed his face
 and rustled through his long hair
The chatter of the birds had become one with the whispers of the black elders,
melding with the rhythmic babbling of the little brook,
which wound its way to the distance behind
the humble grange.
But it has not always been like that.

One thousand seven hundred years ago,
during the celebration of the two moons,
the enemy forayed over powered the villagers
under the cloak of darkness.
Brave men were cut down where they stood in the cold crisp autumn night.
The ones who still had life in their veins escaped in despair,
but regathered quickly and formed a resistance.
Many among them, women and children,
 only armed with axes, torches, and pitchforks.
And it seemed as if all hope was forsaken...There's nothing left of you
So when I left the loop
What were you trying to prove
You're skin and bones crumbling
But now the clouds are parting go
With blue skies and endless heights
So just fill your lungs and breathe
Slow it down just wait
Take some time to question life
While you're young and learning
Take it slow just stay
I know it's hard but moving fast
You're going to miss the journey
Death embrace me
Izanami take me take me
Life embrace me
Izanagi take me home
You're gonna miss the journey
Take me home
The earth is coming to life again
Blue skies and endless heights
So face east to the sunrise
This is my resting place resting place inside my mind
You know it's fine to take your time
You're skin and bones and crumbling
Just know your clock is ticking
It's moving so fast
And all the clouds are parting
It's beaming with light
So take my hand and trust me
Because we are going to see the sunrise

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts fo steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Faster than a lazer bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind ressurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller作曲 : Lamb Of God
Pray for blood
Pray for the cleansing
Pray for the flood
Pray for end of this nightmare
This lie of a life can as quickly as it came dissolve

We seek only reprieve
And welcome the darkness
The myth of a meaning, so lost and forgotten

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell

Pray for solace
Pray for resolve
Pray for a savior
Pray for deliverance
Some kind of purpose, a glimpse of a light in this void of existence

Oh...
Now witness the end of an age
Hope dies in hands of believers
Who seek the truth in the liar's eyes

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

You're never alone
You're never alone

You're never alone
You're never alone
Walk with me in hellStanding firm against all odds
Guarding the most sacred home
We protect the realm of Gods
Our destiny is carved in stone
Three evil giants of the south
Are constantly on the attack
With lies and fire from their mouths
But we always send them back
We are brothers of the north
Who are sharing the all father's blood
Marching down the left hand path
We are spawned by Asagods

We're the Guardians

A thousand times or even more

We will never let it fall'

An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time.
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.
Judgment day the second coming arrives.
Before you see the light you must die.

Forgotten children, conform a new faith,
Avidity and lust controlled by hate.
never ending search for your shattered sanity,
Souls of damnation in their own reality.
Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters,
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.

Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity.

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.
A force that has lived all eternity.
A never ending search for a truth never told.

Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

He said: Just sign your name across the dotted line
and take advantage of the goods I have to offer
It won’t cost you much just a single drop of blood
and I’ll hand you the things you have long been wishing for
It’s an easy way to choose, what do you have to lose ?

Will I fall ? Opulentiam aeternam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall ? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem
Will I fall ? Venustatem infinitam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand or fall ? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem

Should I sign and end this lifelong string of broken dreams of failure,
shattered hopes, of trials and tribulations ?
It won’t cost a thing all the world will hear me sing
and I’d have all the riches, the fame and everything
It’s an easy way to choose, what do I have to lose ?

Will I fall ? Opulentiam aeternam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall ? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem
Will I fall ? Venustatem infinitam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand or fall ? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem

Should I sign and blindly dance along the piper’s tune
or should I rather trust my inner voice to guide me ?
I don’t own a lot but I still got one last shot so do
I need to believe in a promise and its seed ?
Am I willing to choose when it’s myself I could lose ?

Will I fall ? Opulentiam aeternam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall ? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem
Will I fall ? Venustatem infinitam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand or fall ? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finemFrom the coast of gold, Across the seven seas

I'm travlin on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else

I close my eyes, and think of home

Another city goes by, In the night

Ain't it funny how it is

You never miss it till it's gone away
And my heart is lying there

And will be to my dying day

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those
Wasted Years
Face up...make your stand

And realize your living in the golden years
Too much time on hands, I got you on my mind

Can't ease this pain, So easily

When you can't find the words to say

It's hard to make it through another day

And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those
Wasted Years

Face up...make your stand

And realize your living in the golden years

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those
Wasted Years
Face up...make your stand
And realize your living in the golden years

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those
Wasted Years
Face up...make your stand
And realize your living in the golden yearsRESTART ELECTROHEART
DÉJÀ VU I FALL APART
FIVE MINUTES FALLING BACK
WITH MY ELECTROHEART

I feel divine
It’s like I travel faster
As I reboot
The darkness has no empathy
It’s hard to see
I feel the world is shattered
In tears they cry
Am I about to be erased
Soulless torn apart
Born to die right from the start
Cyanide runs in my Electroheart

NEVER LEFT IT FROM THE START
TIMER SET I LEFT THE PAST FOR YOU
And as silence surrounds me
With echoes of cries
From my imminent life
WITH MY ELECTROHEART

I plant the seed
To make them struggle harder
I reap their tears
Bring harvest from their misery
Repent repeat
The force of life scattered
Indeed I try to cleanse it
To infinity
Feel your soul depart
Now your flesh is my own art
Cyanide runs in my Electroheart

Witchcraft
It’s out of context
I better come back
With my complexity
Fractals
What I can’t bring back
I came in contact
With my depravity

珈略山梦境联盟You say you're tired of climbing higher
And you gave your best shot
Well you're not walking in the
Garden of Eden baby
No this life ain't that way
Still somewhere in your heart you know
You got so much more you need to show
So don't talk of hangin' up your dreams
Success has no charity
I see an angel with beautiful wings
And she just don't wanna fly
So if you want it
You can have it all
Turn it on, turn it on
Every dream you can dream
Turn it on, turn it on
You've got to reach
For the sky
I remember you a year or two ago
A fighter with stars in your eyes
But now it's hard and you're feeling lonely
So you hide behind your
make-believe smiles
And you're drowning in the sea of love
While you're losing sight of higher ground
Don't it feel good to close your eyes
You're only believing your own lies
I see a fighter with fists of steel
And she just don't want to fight
Well do you want it
You can have it all
Turn it on, turn it on
Every dream you can see
Turn it on, turn it on
You've got to reach
For the sky
I see an angel with beautiful wings
And she just don't want to fly
Well do you want it
You can have it all
Turn it on, turn it on
Every dream you can see
Turn it on, turn it on
You've got to reach
For the skyThese shallow thoughts are flowing quickly to an end from your mouth
But did you know that you're drowning my dreams in your doubt
Take time to see what you are and what you're doing to me
Does shutting me down pushing me out make you feel free
You're just another stone in my way
But you won't become a brick that I lay
Placing the path in front of me to reach the goals that I seek
Trace back the lines we've drawn and picture what this life could be

If I could find a way to turn back time
I won't change you can't change me
Why would you even try?
Take your words and walk away because I stand to hear say
Everything that you think I will never be

It feels like every time I speak you turn my words around on me
So I'm treading carefully always afraid to breathe
Leave me be and let me reach all of the things that you don't believe
I could ever hold in my hands
How could you ever hope to understand?
Trace back the lines we've drawn and picture what this life could be
If I could find a way to turn back time
I won't change you can't change me
Why would you even try?
Take your words and walk away because I stand to hear say
Everything that you think I will never be

There's a good chance that I've made too many mistakes to ever redeem myself
But if I spend my whole life trying to fix the past then I might as well
Give up hope of happiness and the will to go on
I'd rather find fulfillment in what I am than be lost in what I'll never get back
They say my dreams only last till the end of the night
But if you'd open your eyes you'd see they carry to the morning light
I don't need sleep to live my dreams so stay the hell away from me

If I could find a way to turn back time
I won't change you can't change me
Why would you even try?
Take your words and walk away because I stand to hear say
Everything that you think I will never beWhose to know if your soul will fade at all
The one you sold to fool the world
You lose your self-esteem along the way
Good god' you're coming up with reasons
Good god' you're dragging it out
Good god' it's the changing of the seasons
It feels so great' so follow me down and just...
Fake it if your out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa' you're such a ****ing hypocrite
You should know that the lies won't hide your flaws
No sense in hiding all of yours
You gave up on your dreams along the way
Good god' you're coming up with reasons
Good god' you're dragging it out
Good god' it's the changing of the seasons
It feels so great' so follow me down and just...
Fake it if your out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa' you're such a ****ing hypocrite

I can fake with the best of anyone
I can fake with the best of them all
I can fake it with the best of anyone
I can fake it all
Whose to know if your soul will fade at all
The one you sold to fool the world
You lose your self-esteem along the way
Good god' you're coming up with reasons
Good god' you're dragging it out
Good god' it's the changing of the seasons
It feels so great' so follow me down and just...
Fake it if your out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa' you're such a ****ing hypocrite

While you were out...
the message says
You left a number
and I tried to call
But they wrote it down
in a perfect Spanish scrawl
perfect Spanish scrawl

Yet again
I'm missing you
King size bed
（in a） hotel someplace
I hear your name
I see your face
I see your face

（The） back street dolls
and the side door johnnies
The wide eyed boys with their bags full of money
Back in the alley
going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail
of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be
so high I know
if the times gone by
hadn't been so low
The best laid plans
come apart at the seams
and shatter all my dreams

Sometimes I feel like Screaming
close my eyes
It's times like this
my head goes down
and the only thing I know is the name of this town
name of this town

Yet again
I'm missing you
won't be long
O' coming home
Until that distant time
I'll be moving on
I'll be moving on

I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands
I take a look up at the sky and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red
Please, won't you push me for the last time
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no ****ing fun
You want a martyr, I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done
You told me think about it, well I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
Ahhh...
The thing I think I love
Will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up
Pubescent drama queen
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinking late
Scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore
The thought of you's no ****ing fun
You want a martyr I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done
You told me think about it, well I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
Imagine living like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
And if the bass shakes the earth underground
We'll start a new revolution now
(Now! Alright here we go)
Hail Mary, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating
Come at me, now this is war!
**** with this new beat
Oh!
Now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
I was just a product of the street youth rage
Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
I know you well but this ain't a game
Blow the smoke in diamond shape
Dying is a gift so close your eyes and rest in peace
You told me think about it, well I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
Imagine living like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
We are the shadows screaming take us now
We'd rather die than live to rust on the ground

Woh  woh  wohhhhhhhh
We  are  riding  for  the  battlefield  in  force  tonight
Fury  of  the  darkest  evil  cry  for  war
Far  beyond  the  boundaries  of  hell  and  starlight
On  the  road  to  lands  unknown  forever  more
Through  the  caverns  far  below  our  quest  will  lead  us
Onwards  through  the  ice  and  snow  forever  more
Standing  fighting  full  of  hate  the  time  has  come  now
Stand  and  sound  the  guns  of  glory  cry  for  war
On  wings  of  glory  we  will  carry  on
Far  across  forgotten  lands  towards  the  distant  sun
And  in  the  darkness  shining  far  beyond  the  starlight
Lightning  is  striking  from  the  dark  dawning  shadows
And  in  the  kingdom  of  the  everlasting  sun
When  the  glory  of  the  master's  time  has  come!
Into  the  fires  of  forever  we  will  fly  through  the  heavens
With  the  power  of  the  universe  we  stand  strong  together
Through  the  force  in  our  power,it  will  soon  reach  the  hour
For  victory  we  ride,Fury  of  the  Storm!
Here  we  are  the  chosen  ones  we  can  not  fail  now
Spilling  all  the  blood  on  the  fires  below
Smashing  through  the  boundaries  with  the  fire  and  fury
Killing  all  the  mortals  down  the  winding  road
Hellfires  are  raging  the  storm  growing  strong
On  the  path  to  victory  towards  the  distant  sun
And  in  the  darkness  shining  far  beyond  the  starlight
Lightning  is  striking  from  the  dark  dawning  shadows
And  in  the  kingdom  of  the  everlasting  sun
When  the  glory  of  the  master's  time  has  come!
Into  the  fires  of  forever  we  will  fly  through  the  heavens

Theres a place just south of witches valley
Where they say the wind wont blow
And they only speak in whispers of a name
Theres a lady they say who feeds the darkness
It eats right from her hand
With a crying shout shell search you out
And freeze you where you stand

Lady evil, evil
Shes a magical, mystical woman
Lady evil, evil in my mind
Shes queen of the night
All right!

In a place just south of witches valley
Where they say the rain wont fall
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed
Theres a lady they say who needs the darkness
She cant face the light
With an awful shout, shell find you out
And have you before the night
Lady evil, evil
Shes a magical, mystical woman
Lady evil, evil on my mind
Shes queen of the night

So if you ever get to witches valley
Dont dream or close your eyes
And never trust your shadow in the dark
cause theres a lady I know who takes your vision
And turns it all around
The things you see are what youll be, lost and never found
Lady evil, evil
Shes a magical, mystical woman
Lady evil, evil on my mind
Shes queen of the night
Gonna do you right!
Shes the queen of sin
Look out, shell pull you in!

He was a boy
She was a girl
Can i make it any more obvious
He was a punk
She did ballet
What more can i say
He wanted her
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends
Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth
5 years from now
She sits at home
Feeding the baby she's all alone
She turns on tv
Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin up MTV
She calls up her friends
They already know
And they've all got
Tickets to see his show
She tags along
Looks up at the man that she turned down
Stands in the crowd
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
Sorry girl but you missed out
Well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see,
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy
And I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each others world
I'm with the skater boy
I said see you later boy
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know
I'm with the skater boy
I said see you later boy
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio

"Tornado Of Souls" “

This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry
Not for the money, not for the fame
Not for the power, just no more games

But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a 1000 days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years, not from the use
Not from the tears, just self abuse

But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a 1000 days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

Who's to say what's for me to say
Who's to say what's for me to be
Who's to say what's for me to do
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me

Riff

The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Solo   (by Marty Friedman)

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel
I warn you of the fate
Proven true to late
Your tongue twist perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death作曲 : Harris
 作词 : Harris
When The Wild Wind Blows
Have you heard what they said on the news today
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror, see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow
They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
Wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today
Have you heard what they said about us all
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us
Have you heard, have you heard?
There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it, it will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know
They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired; that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down

Upside down

He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down he****ce,

Saying Grace

Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind

Left behind

Of a lifetime spent together long ago

Will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now

For when the crucial moment comes

To take their refuge in the shelter

Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting

They're in the shelter feeling snug

Not long to wait for absolution

Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait

Can't believe all the lying,
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over

Survivors unite, all as one

Got to try and help each other

Got the will to overcome

I can't believe all the lying,
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout,
Just another when the wild wind blows...Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied
So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone that's all
A tout le monde (To all the world)
A tous mes amis (To all my friends)
Je vous aime (I love you)
Je dois partir (I have to leave)
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living are scarred
A tout le monde (To all the world)
A tous mes amis (To all my friends)
Je vous aime (I love you)
Je dois partir (I have to leave)
These are the last words

You love runnin' that mouth
Thinkin' you got it figured out
But you're a face in the crowd
Fake it till you make it
Spittin' all the same shit out
Then you sit back down on a made up throne
Oh, but everyone knows so
Don't say you tried
You're just making it personal
Don't feed them lies
You're just making it fictional
The web is wide, you're caught inside
And it's looking more pitiful
Believe this time
That I'm taking it personal
Headcase, you're so delusional
You're so vain that it hurts
Sell out just so that you'll be seen
But you'll never be heard
'Cause you got a habit
Of burning all your bridges down
Then you'll sit back down on a made up throne
Oh, but everyone knows so
Don't say you tried
You're just makin' it personal
Don't feed them lies
You're just makin' it fictional
The web is wide, you're caught inside
And it's lookin' more pitiful
Believe this time
That I'm takin' it personal
(That I'm takin' it personal)
All the wrong chances that you've already wasted
Falter under pressure, thought you never could take it
And you're blamin' other people for the things that you bring
You get told that everyone knows it
Don't say you tried
You're just makin' it personal
Don't feed them lies
You're just makin' it fictional
The web is wide, you're caught inside
And it's lookin' more pitiful

Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it


You say...new sound
The shit's loaded and they're ready to go
A bit too much just like the old sound
Already heard it for the 'hundredth time

One hundred more, another same sound
Running them off of the machine that you know
It sounds sublime, they're breaking new ground
They should have another hit this time

Come on
You should just leave it alone
It doesn't have any soul
Just...
And stop pretending to know
As the countless numbers hunger for world wild renown
All the baby sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like that?

I'm still surrounded by the new sound
I've had enough and I'm ready to go
I stran go hung to write the world now
The new obsession will fade in time
I fear reminder of the past now
i'll come up with you not be ready to go
They
I think you've given us a few this time

Come on
You should just leave it alone
It doesn't have any soul
Just...
And stop pretending to know
As the countless numbers hunger for world wild renown
All the ...sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like that?

As it's blown apart, hundreds throw away
Makes me question just what I'm ...
Brothers throw apart, mindless drones enslaved
Makes me search for an answer
I don't want to know
It's like a plague from below
Killing all that I know
One hundred voices the same
Drench their sorrow with fame

As the countless numbers hunger for world wild renown
All the ...sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
As the countless numbers hunger for world wild renown
All the ...sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like that?
Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it
Tell me you like itTake my misery I give all of it.
Take one chance I ll be there.
Offering all of myself
I give everything for my last opportunity.
Emery stones demonstrate and achieve what I wanted.

Relentless chaos is all that has been.

Thoughts of being greater have fallen fast.
This highland contains whatever may come.
How senseless can you be?
How confused can you be?
Relentless chaos is all that has been....

Look at us now higher than before.
Desire to emulate and create all.
Remember bringing this down?
How could you bring this down?
Please tell me why you tried so hard
knowing this would happen one day.
Take my misery I give all of it.
Take one chance Ill be there.
Offering all of myself
I give everything for my last opportunity.
Concentrated on destroying this vision.
Try to live this down
when I find you begging at my feet.

All your words have fallen to the ground
where they belong.
All your words have fallen to the ground
where they belong.

All your words have fallen to the ground
where they belong.Black souls, empty bodies
You had me fooled straight from the start
We pray for an answer.
We have to fight or be hollow just like them
Walking lifeless,
Have we been left for the dead?
Black souls, empty bodies
We have to fight or be hollow just like them
They're coming for us now (whoa)
So don't make a sound (whoa)
Is there anybody left to see the sun?
Is there anybody left to cure the dead?
Unaware and unawake
Unaware and unawake
Every city is burning,
We're all wasting away
Nothing will end this, nothing to prove
There's nowhere to run, all hell is breaking loose
They're coming for us now (whoa)
So don't make a sound (whoa)
Is there anybody left to see the sun?
Is there anybody left to cure the dead?
Unaware and unawake
Unaware and unawake
Something tells me we could be here for a while.
And all I know is if you can't run learn to die
And now I wonder if we'll make it through the night.
All I know is if you can't run learn to die
With the setting sun put the gun in my hand
Pull the trigger, don't fail me now
With the setting sun put the gun in my hand
Don't fail me now
It's starting again
We're going hollow
We're going hollow
Something tells me we could be here for a while.
And all I know is if you can't run learn to die
And now I wonder if we'll make it through the night.
All I know is if you can't run learn to die
Whoa, whoa
Don't fail me now
Whoa, whoa
Don't fail me now
Whoa, whoaGood days are gone - and I don't really know
How could I save you?
All that's left - is a mandolin
To play and cry and I sing
Oh, my Helena - put your hands in mine
This world is not in harmony - what happens is a crime
Chorus:But we got nothing to fear - we are the world
Together we can change our future now
Oh, we got nothing to fear - we are the world
Burn down these walls of sorrow - let's go!
We are the world

Days of fight - I don't wanna hide
I'll be a savior
Come outside - together we are strong
We'll get along and I sing
Oh, my Helena - let's play your mandolin
Hope someday, in this land, again the sun will shine
Chorus:Cause we got nothing to fear - we are the world
Together we can change our future now
Oh, we got nothing to fear - we are the world
Burn down these walls of sorrow - let's go!
We are the world
Solo
Chorus:Oh, we got nothing to fear - we are the world
Take my hand, take my hand tonight
Oh, we got nothing to fear - we are the world
Together we can change our future now
Oh, we got nothing to fear - we are the world
Burn down these walls of sorrow - let's go!
We are the worldTell me was it all worth it,to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low.
Sunk this low.
Rotten to the core.
So who's left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost.
Now we're gone,left without a trace,
but we took something they cannot replace.
A match made in heaven,
paved the road to hell.
We've been down this path before.
Cold blooded retribution.
So **** your revolution.
You chew up peace and spit it out as war.
You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door.
You are rotten to the core.
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger.
If you're looking for tyrants,take a look in the mirror.
You knew all along,that the cancer would spread,
so don't be surprised to find a price on your head.
Sorry son,but we destoryed your home,
we murdered your family,now you're on your own.
Collateral damage,face down in the sand.
Watch the dominoes fall,it's all just part of the plan.
A match made in heaven.
Paved the road to hell.
We've been down this path before.
Cold blooded retribution.
So **** your revolution.
A match made in heaven.
Paved the road to hell.
We've been down this path before.
And every execution,the price of your collusion.
You knew all along,that the cancer would spread,
so don't be surprised to find a price on your head.
Tell me was it all worth it,to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low.
Sunk this low.
You are rotten to the core.
You are rotten to the core.
You are rotten to the core.
You are rotten to the core.This empire of silence sways in the wind
Leaves for the winter won't you shelter me
Look in the mirror, tell me what you see
A cause for the cancer or a remedy?

Every rung beneath my feet
The weight will bare on shoulders build to lean
The strength inside a seed, we're all alone
If I learn from our deceits
Let the water guide us to the sea
For all our wounds will heal
We're all alone

We're building walls
Where there should have been bridges
Borders in the land that we roam
We pray for war like it's a ****ing religion
When greed is all we know

Conditioned innocent with loves intention
Confused together, realize we're all the same
We're all the same

This empire of silence sways in the wind
Leaves for the winter won't you shelter me
Look in the mirror, tell me what you see
A cause for the cancer or a remedy?

Pull out the knife that you've earned！
This world's a loss to an age of a self loving race
With no desire to change
Emergency positions please, reprieve humanity

We're building walls
Where there should have been bridges
Borders in the land that we roam
We pray for war like it's a ****ing religion
When greed is all we know

We're building walls
Where there should have been bridges
Borders in the land that we roam
We pray for war like it's a ****ing religion
When greed is all we know

We won't give up on the truth
We won't give in to their rules
We're not afraid of a world corrupted
We won't give up on youWe’ve always been kept in the dark
A vision of our sanctuary
Overshadowed by deceit from the start
The lie whthin belief
All our thoughts and uncertainties
Are mirrored by our grieving plea
The breathless wind
The verse of debauchery
Scorched by the tyrants of industry
She cries what is it you want from me?
So I will beg the feeble question
Our divided species asks
If we’re gunning for this
But we know that it’s diminishing fast
Can we at least enjoy it when it lasts?
The tidal waves of fear are bearing down on me
Our confusion connects us
our deception unites us
Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know?
Our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I know
Never say,nihilist of modern day
Let’s feel
Let’s feel this together
We are a species of course we fight
Fighting started life
It’s time to rectify
Stop living in your fantasy life
Don’t let your body be a graveyard for your mind
Turn it up,turn it up
This is a broadcast brought to you by the rank and life
Not the back of the room
Exploit our minds and keep us idolising ignorence
There's a spark in the fuse
There’s a fire inside that’ll guide us through
The remains of a nation divided
Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know
Our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I know
Never safe,never safe
In a black market democracy
Never safe,to no avail we turn the other way
Let’s feel,Let’s feel this together
All of my struggles
Like steel trying to become wood
But seeing it in others is a forest fire
All of my struggles
We’re still trying to become one
When will we learn that all we have is enough?
Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know
Our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I knowA short man from Texas
A man of the wild
Thrown into combat,
Where bodies lie piled
Hides his emotions,
His blood is running cold
Just like his victories,
His story unfolds
Bright, a white light,
If there'd be,
Any glory in war
Let it rest,
On men like him
Dead men will never come back
Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
Going to hell and back!
A man of the 15th
A man of Can Do
Friends fall around him
And yet he came through
Let them fall face down
If they must die
Making it easier
To say goodbye
Bright, a white light,
If there'd be,
Any glory in war
Let it rest,
On men like him
Who went to hell and came back
Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
Going to hell and back!
Oh gather 'round me
And listen while I speak
Of a war where hell is six feet deep
And all along the shore
Where cannons still roar
They're haunting my dreams
They're still there when I sleep
He saw crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldier sleeps
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
He charged and attack
He went to hell and back!Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it’s black or white?
Mama, can you help me try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man
My daddy lived a lie
Its just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away
Ohhh, if there’s one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don’t want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond
Rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge
Just show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Take a look around you, nothings what it seems
We’re living in a broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake your helping hand
Everybody, brave enough to take a stand
I knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What’s left to believe?
Ohhh~
Now when this world keeps trying, to drag me down
I've gotta raise my hands
Gonna stand my ground
I say, hey, have a nice day作曲 : Kokko, Kokko, Kokko
  A man -highest in rank
 Always commands
 Obeys the will
 Of the mighty word
 
 Wealth is all he wants to reach
 Don' t give a damn to our land
 
 
 He cannot see what is happening in our world
 Our system falls by his hand
 Conqueror' s end
 
 
 With toxic waste master creates
 Catastrophies that lead to the end
 
 A biowar man never can win
 Technology his only reward
 
 
 
 Twisted creation of mankindFight!

I will fight for this
I will fight for what I worked for
Carry!
I can't carry your weight
Carry your weight anymore

Protect!
I've protected the family
Now I will protect myself

Give!
I have set you free
But what have you gave me
I can't see the point in living day by day
Opportunities arranged for you to take

I can't see the point in living day by day

Why must I carry you alone? You're killing me

Take!
you have taken it all
Taken everything I am

Push!
I've been pushed to the edge
I am never coming back

Break!
The way you broke my trust
And now I will break free of you
Faith!
There is no faith anymore

I have no faith in you
I can't see the point in living day by day

Opportunities arranged for you to take

I can't see the point in living day by day

Why must I carry you alone? You're killing me

I hope this makes you
I hope this makes you
I hope this makes you finally recognize

I hope this makes you finally recognize

I hope you see this through my shattered eyes
I hope this makes you finally recognize

I hope you see this through my shattered eyes

I can't see the point in living day by day

Opportunities arranged for you to take

I can't see the point in living day by day

Why must I carry you alone? You're killing meMinutes seem like days
Since fire ruled the sky
The rich became the beggars
And fools became the wise
Memories linger in my brain
Of burning from the acid rain
A pain I never have won
Nothing here remains
No future and no past
No one could foresee
The end that came so fast
Hear the prophet make his guess
That paradise lies to the west
So join his quest for the sun
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be
The world slowly decays
Destruction fills my eyes
Harboring the image
Of a spiraling demise
Burning winds release their fury
Simulating judge and jury
Drifting flurries of pain
Deafening silence reigns
As twilight fills the sky
Eventual supremacy
As daylight waits to die
Darkness always calls my name
A pawn in this recurring game
Humanity going insane
Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be
Fragments of what used to be
Skeletons of society
Minutes seem like days
Corrosion fills the sky
Morbid dreams of anarchy
Brought judgment in disguise
Memories linger in my brain
Life with nothing more to gain
Perpetual madness remains
Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be
Fragments of what used to be
Skeletons of society作曲 : Gyllenhammer
Born a believer, I walk alone
Can′t find a place where I feel at home
Well I′m crazy, but I am sane
I′m guilty, but not to blame
This is my nature, who I am
If you don′t like it, here I stand
I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Shove it in my mouth
I can't control my evil
I, I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Have a bigger bite
I love you baby, though I hate you
I'm a double nature!
Now a heretic, I have become
I've lost my faith in God and man
I am a demon, free from sin
But there′s no angel who lets me in
My wheels are rolling, they′re rolling fast
Straight outta Hell, away from my past
I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Shove it in my mouth
I can't control my evil
I, I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Have a bigger bite
I love you baby, though I hate you
I'm a double nature!
Now here′s a warning, some final words
Turn me down, and you′ll burn, burn...
I am awakened, I never sleep
My eyes are bleeding, I′m a freak
I′m short of patience, don′t mean no harm
I′m just a guy with a burning heart
I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Shove it in my mouth
I can't control my evil
I, I wanna keep it, though I eat it
Have a bigger bite
I love you baby, now I hate you
I'm a double nature!I've been erased from the old me.
Can you tell me again, can you hold me if I won't lay till the morning sun?
It pulls you out and takes you under..
I thought you'd hate me. But I needed you
I thought you'd hate me, But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me, for losing you.
I thought you knew.
Feel like the pages of a story that we can't stop.
And, now I can't replace you with another thread.
Take one more step, I'll jump with you..
I thought you'd hate me. But I needed you
I thought you'd hate me, But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me, for losing you.
I thought you knew.
Looking back at your building, you came crashing down. You'll think I'll forget that.
Never gonna take it back (You know where I lie)
Looking back at your bullshit, I came crashing down. You'll think I'll forget that.
Never gonna take you back (You know where I am)
I thought you knew.
It's hard enough you standing next to me,
You assumed with every moment explained with you
I'll need to know that you believe in this, or just releasing me to d茅j脿 vuI!
I never wanted you to understand.
Why!?
I want to make you believe in me.
I thought you'd hate me. But I needed you
I thought you'd hate me, But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me, for losing you.



I thought you knew.So I feel it right, to say,
That you are my, one regret,
To keep you here, was my mistake,
One day I'll learn
You made me what I am
You made me what I am
I am your design, (failed and tested by default)
I am your design, (broken arms can't fix themselves)
I am your design, (failed and tested by default)
I am your design, (broken arms can't fix themselves)
We'll pacify, all of our thoughts, not so much as a whisper,
We're embedded in silence now,
And this, my wish, you could tell the truth,
Well I've never felt this awkward
I am your design, (failed and tested by default)
I am your design, (broken arms can't fix themselves)
I am your design, (failed and tested by default)
I am your design, (broken arms can't fix themselves)
This is murder,
Of my heart(x4)
I am your design, (failed and tested by default)
I am your design, (broken arms can't fix themselves)
I am your design, (failed and tested by default)
I am your design
We built this,
On your grave(x8)Remember back in school we used to talk about
When we redeem in ten years
Seems like everyone took one step forward
While we took two steps back
It's not like I'm asking them to wait up it's just
Don't you have a feel like rewinding the ****ing tape?

Let's make a toast to the past
Even though we knew at heart
That it wouldn't last
I'm holding on to the memories
Do I have the best years behind me?
I feel the time is running out
We grew up, move on
and never looking back
And I guess I'm scared that my life can't go
back to those days when we were young
and ****ing careless

We had the world right in front of us
Planned out, all set
and we were young at heart
But as time goes by
I believe that the world is ****ing spinning
and it tears us apart

I'm waiting on the next wave from my life
To sweep me off my feet
I can barely hold on for myself
What about my dreams?
What about my dreams?
It's the illusion of being free
It wraps up around me
it holds me down and takes the breath right of me

The hands of time is slowly tearing everything apart
Will we stand together?

Do you remember all these years ago?
shooting stars above, we're laying down below
I remember our conversations
We lived our lives in our imaginations
The sand is pouring through the hourglass
We're stuck at the bottom with no turning back
At least for me
Cause all I can see is the memories of
everything I wished we could be
I'm holding on to the thought of who we used to be

I used to be the one that you'd turn to
When your days were rough

We were young at heart
Careless and free
I miss the kids we used to be

I used to be the one that you'd turn to
When your days were rough

We were young at heart
Careless and free
I miss the kids we used to be

Do I have the best years of my life right behind me?

The hands of time is slowly tearing everything apart
Will we stand together?
Let us see another day
We were young and reckless
And nothing would hold us down
I miss the kids we used to be

Nothing in this world will hold us down
Nothing in this world will hold us downEchoes silent

they saved.
They took the challenge to keep our faith.
They gave their selves to the streets,
they saved.
They took the challenge to keep our faith.
We can't imagine the way.
We can't imagine the day.
They put their hate in the waves,
they put their heart in the way.
They gave their selves to the streets, they saved.
They fought to keep our Faith.
Cut their life away from safe,
to save.
Leave the blind alone in the reign.
But I know I couldn't be taught to die with pride,
for queen or country.
I know I couldn't be taught to die
not another slave to the hive.
I've seen the names,
I'm not young and afraid, the numbers the same.
They could decide when we die
but we decide what we defend.
We sing the sorrow of the dead from our souls.
And hope that they found peace,
dying alone.
We sing the sorrow of the dead from our souls.
And hope that they found peace,
dying alone.
Out their life away from safe,
to save.
The mindless freedom puts our nation to shame.
Are you grateful of the graves?
I speak the words of a weathered man,
there's blood on the streets that my son walks down.
If we suffered for this, it has to change.
They gave their selves to the streets,
they saved.
They took the challenge to keep our faith.
They gave their selves to the streets,
they saved.
They took the challenge to keep our faith.Let's go
Your kingdom is of emptiness
Invisible empire of illusion
There's no majesty in your empty words
Your ideology, self delusion
Revisionism is the future
So let's hail the same old dawn
Kneel before the same old order
You're no kings, only pawns
You're waiting for tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
Ha, you're waiting for your new dawn
So sad to say there isn't one
Because, tomorrow belongs to nobody
Tomorrow belongs to nobody
Ha, you're waiting for tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
Ha, you're waiting for your new dawn
So sad to say there isn't one
You fools tomorrow belongs to nobody, to no one
Tomorrow belongs to nobodyRise Up and take Control

Lose their way
Lost in a world of ignorance
Led astray
Led astray by the face of the hour
You consume it all
It's forcing you to break
In the light of this fire we started
We slowly fade away
Outlive the heroes you named and shamed
We outlived the heroes you named and shamed
Pictures black
A poisned page
Forgive and replace
Hold your breath
Do you still hold your head high
With our names scribed across your chest?
Take your eyes and watch me from afar
A presence lost
Can never be found
Endless memories of nothing at all
Endless memories of nothing at all
Pick myself up off the floor
These are the moments we live for
How did you see?
How did you see?
How did you know?
How did you know?
The fire burns brighter the deeper you go
In the face of a strangerThere comes a time when all else fails
You put the pressure on me how can I prevail?
This weight I carry keeps piling on
He is not the one, love blinds what's right from wrong
What's right from wrong
Watch their lust it sparks alive
And it tears me up inside
I'll admit I'm terrified
Jealousy is my new guide
I must reside, I must abide
Live out my life caught in a lie
But I might die, if I don't try
I try to find as I search my mind
Will you take his hand and leave me behind?
The aisle clears as my hope eludes
He's burning through my ****ing solitude
Watch their lust it sparks alive
And it tears me up inside
I'll admit I'm terrified
Jealousy is my new guide
I must reside, I must abide
Live out my life caught in a lie
But I might die, if I don't try
I'm so sick of this romantic tragedy (this tragedy!)
I'm plunging head first to insanity (insanity!)
He's come to stay and I never said that it was okay
His broken words won't make this right, I can see straight through all his lies
This can't be real I don't care how he makes her feel
This is not his place and in any case he can pack up and get out of my face!
Watch their lust it sparks alive
And it tears me up inside
I'll admit I'm terrified
Jealousy is my new guide
I must reside, I must abide
Live out my life caught in a lie
But I might die, if I don't try
Die young!
Can we stop this wedding?
He is not her other, I'm her only one
Back off!
He holds her safe and sound
Even now, while she's caught in his whisper!Where am I?
The grey clouds obliterate the light blue sky
They're approaching quickly
The sloppy and filthy streets are
The streets are reflecting
Reflecting the human condition
Everywhere I look I can only see narrow alleyways
The bridges are burning
No chance to heal the wounds, no time-out from the selfish world
The cold environment is looking at me
In hopes (****ing getting) of getting answers
I close my eyes to stop the time, to forget all this misery
Where am I?
Where's the place where the roses still grow?
I can't hear through these hazy words anymore
Is this the reality or just my perception?
Wait for a sign but you can't see me
Through this blurred visibility
But I can see you
The fear in your face
The fluttering eyelid
But you can't hide
You can't
I perceive there is a way out
This might be a solution that cures the world
Can't you feel it?
Can't you really see it?
So shout out, convince me
Step up!
So step up
Step up
You're the gunman
I am just the bullet shot from your gun now
Shot!
I am just a bullet shot from your gunWe are the broken
We are the wasted
An unspoken generation
Screaming out til they hear us now
Woah, woah
Do you ever feel like you have a voice at all
If you had the chance to stand up to everyone
Do you ever feel like the world's turned its back on you
I can't take it anymore
(We're gonna bring 'em down)
You know we're stronger than we've ever been before
We will never surrender
You can't stop us now
We are the broken
We are the wasted
An unspoken generation
Screaming out til they hear us now
Screaming out til they hear us now
We are the broken and the useless
We have to start a revolution
Screaming out can you hear us now
Woah, woah
and fight for what's ours
Nothing you say can ever heal these scars
Turn your light for the dark
Together as one, we will follow stars
We now have to take back what they stole
We won't let you take control
I'm like a timebomb ticking, it's starting to explode
We will never surrender
You can't stop us no
We are the broken
We are the wasted
An unspoken generation
Screaming out til they hear us now
Screaming out til they hear us now
We are the broken and the useless
We have to start a revolution
Screaming out can you hear us now
Woah, woah
This is a call to anyone who's ever felt like they don't belong
We are the Youth in Revolt
And we are taking you down
1-2, 1-2-3-4!
We will never surrender
Hey! Hey!
We will never surrender
You can't stop us now
We are the broken
We are the wasted
An unspoken generation
Screaming out til they hear us now
Woah, woah
We are the broken and the useless
We have to start a revolution
Screaming out can you hear us now
Screaming out can you hear us nowYou are we！
Here lies our addiction
The price is a truce
To hide the afflicted right under our nose
Tyrants deprivers of truth
Take what you can
We’ve got nothing to lose
So come and get it
We’ve got nothing to lose
Yeah I ****ing said it
Deprivers of the truth
To be honest they force this upon us
Show us the path
Paved with glass
Sentiment at last
The knife behind your back
Our smoke will paint the sky
Cover up the lights that guide us
Celebrate decline
We made our bed and I will lie to you
that everything’s alright
We’ll dam the river
We’ll dam the river and try to hide from the water
Pre creation in the reign of sin
If the land has been swallowed
We’ll learn how to swim
Begging for our sorrow
The tides are turning
You want your countless wars
We want to count less wars
You want to point the blame
at the heretics
But you’re the hypocrites
Its only hate you preach
And when we call for peace
You call it anarchy
I hope your god can save you
As your devil leads the way
YEAH！！！
We’ve got nothing to lose
So come and get it
We’ve got nothing to lose
Yeah I ****ing said it
Deprivers of the truth
It’s like raking dead leaves in the wind
It’s like saints living life without sins
It’s like digging our graves in the sand
It’s like raking dead leaves in the wind
Our smoke will paint the sky
Cover up the lights that guide us
Celebrate decline
We made our bed and I will lie to you
That everything's alright
You are we
You are we
Lucifer
You are we无歌词Have you looked up lately
（and seen the cold lonely skies）
and looked into the mirror
（and seen your black lonely eyes?）
well i have, and i want to know
（why i feel the death is 'round the corner）
when i still feel so young
（and in my chest i've the beating of）
a thousand youngbloods
（Youngbloods run free forever
forget the death thats ever nearer
youngbloods, young hearts alike
let the fires burn inside your eyes
we won't give up these memories
we won't go near those cemeteries）
and have you ever felt
the breath of the midnight reaper
（his whispers deathly cold,
deathly cold and nearer）
the sun never rises when you're in his presence
（and your tears run black as coal
and your chest ceases its movements）
and your blood runs so cold
（have you felt the darkness calling）
and the whispers in the skies?
well i have, so we need to run together
youngbloods
youngbloods
youngbloods run free forever

forget the deaths thats ever ****ing nearer
light up the sky, and scream
'**** the reaper'
this life is for the keeping
youngbloods just keep on screaming
（Youngbloods run free forever
forget the death thats eve nearer
youngbloods, young hearts alike
let the fires burn inside your eyes
we won't give up these memories
we won't go near those cemeteries）
youngblods
youngbloods
youngbloods just keep on screaming
this life is for the keeping
this song is for the dreamers
youngbloods

youngbloods
youngbloods just keep on screaming
just keep onscreaming
just keep on screaming
let's go
（youngbloods

youngbloods, young hearts alike
let the fires burn inside your eyes
we won't give up these memories
we won't go near those cemeteries
youngbloods, young hearts alike
let the fires burn inside your eyes）Sprinkled by the trappings
Of words that make the outlines
Blur on the showplace that made history
The folk is willed
To parrot the dished up tale
The lure of a higher meaning

Cheat, you had to create
An enemy stereotype
To retrieve your absolution
A forthy poor excuse for your foray
To disengage from the deeps
of your encumbrance

Behold
All our gold
Thousandfold
Bereave me!
Declined
Truths ensign
Forever mine!
Bereave me!

March in with ten legions
Whilst the crucial weapon's not he pillum
But the feather held in your hand
Penned in blood
Your tall tales rule the forum
Altering it into the battlefield

I, the spectral guise
Evoking these baring fears
Pestering your conscript fathers
I smile at my demise and while I die
I cherish the roots of my perseverance

Behold
All our gold
Thousandfold
Bereave me!
Declined
Truths ensign
Forever mine!
Bereave me!

Behold
All our gold
Thousandfold
Bereave me!
Declined
Truths ensign
Forever mine!
Bereave me!作曲 : Buus, Mølbjerg, Nielsen
So hear me now
This weakened voicing
Listen one last time
It is dying
Here at the end I am
Watching closely
Afraid to see you
Afraid to be

So here it is again
This loneliness of mine
I can't seem to find you
I don't believe you're there
Is this your hand?
Is this the turning?
I need to say I lost you
I need to say goodbye

And save me from this blinding night
Of nothing
Save me from the dying
Save me from my god
Choose to find salvation in the sorrow
I hope to see you laughing
Laughing at the end

So here it is again
This loneliness of mine
I can't seem to find you
I don't believe you're there
Is this your hand?
Is this the turning?
I need to say I lost you
I need to say goodbye

I'm standing here in line
Hoping to see
My dreams are intertwined
I'm here by your side
So here it is with me
This old friend of mine
I'm trying to break free
I'm here by your side

So here it is again
This loneliness of mine
I can't seem to find you
I don't believe you're there
Is this your hand?
Is this the turning?
I need to say I lost you
I need to say goodbyeOne last time!
We're back again, you know we're not ******* around
Got a bottle of jack in our hands, you tryna' keep up kid?
Let's see who hits the ground
We've drank the drinks, we've done the drugs, clearly we don't remember
We've come so far, we've shown them all, without us you'd fall and fade away
They say it all breaks down to keeping your feet on the ground
My sole intention is keeping my head in the clouds
They say that I can't last a day in the real world
I say you wouldn't survive one night in mine

Notorious and ***t I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this ***t!
I'm everything we need to make this scene what it should have been
Remember platinum albums, sold out stadiums, leave it to me

Let's tell the truth, not to be rude but we're all irrelevant
This music's dead with a bullet in it's head

Let's wake it up
Who-o-oa
It's so insane, I'm so insane
Going insane, I'm so insane
Leave it to me from hereTears snaking down your skin
Do you feel lonely
Do you feel blue
Alright too
Leaves dancing in the wind
Do you feel angry
Do you feel hungry
Alright too
Alright too
Alright too
No brakes in your broken world
Don't prey on the happy
Don't tell me I'm lucky
Alright too
Leaves dancing in the wind
Do you feel lonely
Do you feel blue
Alright too
Alright too
Alright tooI don't give a **** what you think about it,
I'd just as well kill you today.
I'm cursed with the pain!
No I know, I can't pretend it, I can't pretend it.
Shake another slave.
I hope I never never get it,
I hope I never never get it.

as the one from the trees
when the forests used to sing
or when i locked myself
in the heart of the wood
and threw away the key
you just kept giving yourself away
a gift to cherish until piece by piece
you laid before the roots of time
day by day the nights swallow the sun,
and with every night
the more you gave your sadness came undone
you just kept slipping through the cracks
of my fingertips
i only hope that you remember me
as the one from the trees
when the forests used to sing
instead of when i locked myself
in the heart of the wood
and threw away the key
you're not desire
you're just a ****ing widow
weaving webs among the woods
i'm not the answer but if you take my hand
i'll show you the world of the dead
there you were smiling into the night
i watched you sing for hours on end
we're telltale spiders spinning webs and singing songs
sharing your stories with the moon and the trees
with a world which strung you along i've shut you out
i don't like your stories anymore
they always end so ****ing sad
****
i've turned my back
i've turned my back
on you for good
just keep smiling into the night
i watched you pass me by
every night you died
with a smile on your face
in my dreams you wept blood
from your eyes
just keep smiling into the night
my beautiful bride
just keep smiling into the night
my beautiful bride
i fell for your bleeding crimson eyes
just so you, just so you know
i'll always remember you
as the telltale spider
when darkness crept into our days
sharing stories with the world
until piece by piece you gave your heart away
you're not desire
you're just a ****ing widow
weaving webs among the woods
i'm not the answer but if you take my hand
i'll show you the world of the dead
i hate sad stories they always end the same
i'll never forget how the forests wept

Beatin' up my mind every second with my fist

And everybody wanna run
Everybody wanna hide from da gun

You can dig a rat through this life if you want
But you can't dig the edge off a knife
And now you want your money back

Sweat coming through my shirt keep pushin' even though it hurts
Chasing what I know it's true there's nothing that I would not do
When everyone around me drops I'm never gonna ever stop
I won't waste another minute no I won't
I'm a man on a mission
I'm a man on a mission
I don't need no permission
I'm a man on a mission take it up now take it up now
I ain't waiting and wishing take it up now take it up now
Oh I got that ambition take it up now take it up
I'm a man on a mission
When you look into my eyes you know you gonna see that fire
If you're standing in my way it ain't gonna be your day
Bleed until I own this dream build it like you've never seen
Even at the mountain top I'm never gonna ever stop
I won't wait another minute no I won't
I'm a man on a mission

If words can be weapons,
Then what I say can effect it.
They're not just words on a record.
And I can choose to respect it,
Or choose to infect it.
But once that hits the water,
It's too late to be selective.
If one voice is enough,
To make sleeping giants wake up.
To make armies put their hands up.
And watch whole nations stand up.
It's one belief,
one spark,
One faith and one restart.
And we can reboot the whole chart,
Before it all falls apart
So stand up,
shout it out.
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud.
We only got one shot,
so let's make it count.
It's a take down,
nobody can stop us now.
Stand up,
shout it out.
Sing it loud,
so the world can't drown us out.
And before we depart let's leave a mark.
'Cuz light shines brighter in the dark.
When we scream,
Our lips don't make a sound.
We march with feet on solid ground.
We walk,
where no one wants to go,
On this untraveled road.
So hold on for a moment,
If we're not scared of opponents,
Then with what we have we can own it.
We just plant the seed and keep groanin'.
And when that light shines in the mornin',
They'll still be wakin' up yawnin'.
We'll be smilin' like we expected.
Sweet victory,
one method.
If one voice is enough,
To make sleeping giants wake up.
To make armies put their hands up.
And watch whole nations stand up.
It's one belief,
one spark,
One faith and one restart.
And we can reboot the whole chart,
Before it all falls apart
So stand up,
shout it out.
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud.
We only got one shot,
so let's make it count.
It's a take down,
nobody can stop us now.

When we scream,
Our lips don't make a sound.
We march with feet on solid ground.
We walk,
where no one wants to go,
On this untraveled road.
And I can choose to respect it,
Or choose to infect it.
But once that hits the water,
It's too late to be selective.
If one voice is enough,
To make sleeping giants wake up.
To make armies put their hands up.
And watch whole nations stand up.
It's one belief
one spark,
One faith and one restart.
And we can reboot the whole chart,

*******!In the dark of the night we are demons in silence
In the light of the moon we are the storm of the damned
In the heat of the wild we are the bloodred horizon
Stand anywhere we land

In the call of the wild we are the thunder and lightning
In the roar of the fight we are the sword in your rear
In the heart of the night we are the call of the sirens
Near anytime you fear
Anytime you fear

We are the dark of the night
We are the sermon of fight
We bring the nightside
sacred and wild

We are the demons of light
The holy word you can't fight
We bring the nightside
Sacred and wild

Fight! Fight!
Sacred and wild

In the light of the morning we are preachers and tyrants
By the break of the dawn we are the dark of the land
By the first of the sunlight we are strong as the bible
Stand anywhere we land

When the dark of the night has come we stand up as wild men
When the land of the living dies we rise from the dead
When the last of the sun has gone or exile
We head sanctify the dead
Sanctify the dead

We are the dark of the night
We are the sermon of fight
We bring the nightside
Sacred and wild

We are the demons of light
The holy word you can't fight
We bring the nightside
Sacred and wild

Fight! Fight!

Fight! Fight!
Sacred and wildThere was a time
When you were so close to me
It all has been fine
Two hearts' indignity
But in the still of the night
You have disappeared
The moon it shone so bright
So much I have to fear
Fight the tears of sorrow
Not an endless fight
There is no tomorrow
When love is forced to hide
But in the still of the night
You have disappeared
The moon it shone so bright
So much I have to fear
Fight the tears of sorrow
Not an endless fight
There is no tomorrow
When love is forced to hide
Fight the tears of sorrow
Not an endless fight
There is no tomorrow
When love is forced to hide
Fight the tears of sorrow
Not an endless fight
There is no tomorrow
When love is forced to hide
Fight the tears of sorrow
Not an endless fight
There is no tomorrow
When love is forced to hide
Fight the tears of sorrow
Not an endless fight
There is no tomorrow
When love is forced to hide
Fight the tears of sorrow
Not an endless fightSometimes I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow I need you to go
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just take myself back and
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just take myself back and
Don't stay

Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I just feel like strangling you myself
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow I need to be alone
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just take myself back and
Don't stay

I don't need you anymore,
don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day,
of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore,

Don't stayI become so numb`（haha）
Can I get an encore
Do you want more?
I become so numb`
Can I get an encore
Do you want more?
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down
Time's up,
Ooh yeah,
bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone,
you don't come back, too bad
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'（for DESE GENERATIONS```）
Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waiting for
After me there shall be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump,You get on one foot and-jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the **** is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cuz Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record （what）
We gon' have this muther****er hoppin' in a second （bump bump）
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
Now what the hell are you waiting for
After me there shall be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
I become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
（Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow）
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I become so numb I can feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So nervous, ain't never cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc （and Shady）
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
I become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all``````

Nevertheless am I dressed for the occasion
It's number 32 now here's the situation
If the beat moves your feet then don't change the station
Pack your bags cause we're leaving on a permanent vacation Well,
I'm a disaster A microphone master
Put on your tape and rock your ghetto blaster
It's not about the money, cars, hotels, or resorts
About sweating all the *****es in the biker shorts
I'm Dave Brown Sound and you see me running late
Cause I'm always making time to make your girlie feel great
And I'm Bizzy D from way down town I'm known to rock a mic like a king was a crown
When I'm on top I'm gonna borrow that bootie
Hustling deals like Mickey Macooty
When I wake up I like a pound of bacon Start off the day with my arteries shaking

Well I bring down the house in every city we play
Just from pickin' up the mic' in a usual way
We rock and talk with a bass that's funny
We could even tear it up at a grade school party
Well I can keep the beat but I can't break dance
It's hard to look cool in crazy pants
But I wear 'em anyway even when they look whack
It's my personal way to bring the 80's back

Gave up the life of servin' burger and fries
High cholesterol gettin' grease in my eyes
I was drinkin' underage I belong on stage Hello rock 'n' roll goodbye minimum wage
I'm teachin' you a lesson in mic' control
Makin' rhymes with my letters in my cereal bowl
Lucky number seven every dice I roll
Sum 41 to the power as the boob patrol

Well let's avoid confusion by makin' one thing clear
The rock we're bringin' is gonna instill fear
And the power we control should be revered We sold our soul to Satan two times last year
Take a look to the point, to the point I'm makin' We rock............stone cold bakin' Boys)
And we get outta hand and bust up the room JD is to blame for the Legion of Doom
'Cause I'm the B-I double Z-Y
You ain't better than me, I ain't your average guy
I like to watch girls shake with a kung fu grip
Well the goon platoon is on the flavor trip
We beat down London,
slayed LA Got an APB on the jams we play
So when you're on the stage cold grabbin' your c*ck
We release something the new kings of rock

We have the passion of the unbroken
And our souls we will not sell
You can beat us down but when we come around
We'll damn you all to hell
Waiting for a sign, I guess I missed it on the way
I tried to walk the line but it's more than I could take
I get so tired of waiting; your signal's fading out
You're on the outside before you even know you're out of place
I've had enough and your time is up
So give me something, that one thing real
And I'll say yeah, cause I've been going out of my head again
Just waiting for a lifeline
Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky
While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs 'til you die
Give it to me, give 'til you ain't got anymore
Cause I need it to believe it, that you got any soul
Give it to me give 'til you ain't got anymore
Pick your heart off the floor and scream it out
God save us all
I've given up the grudge and saying all I have to say
Show me how to judge and I'll find another way
I don't know how to fake it; I think I'm breaking down
Under the pressure, before you know it something's gotta give
I've had enough and your time is up
So give me something, that one thing real
And I'll say yeah, cause I've been going out of my head again
Just waiting for a lifeline
Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky
While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs 'til you die
Give it to me, give 'til you ain't got anymore

How can we fake this anymore
To turn our backs away' and chose to just ignore
（Some say）Some say it's ignorance
It makes 'em feel some innocent
It takes away a part of me

When we all fall down' who will take the blame
Will it take

Nothing could ever be this real
A life unsatisfied' that I could never feel
（Some Say）This future's not so bright
Some can't make the sacrifice
It's much more than just black and white
And I won't follow
Tell me why can't you see' it's not the way

I'm sure they never knew enough
I know the pressures won't go away
It's too late
Find out the difference somehow
It's too late to even have faith
Don't think things will ever change
You must be dreaming
Think before you make up your mind
You don't seem to realise
I can do this on my own
And if I fall I'll take it all
It's so easy after all

Believe me 'cause now's the time to try
Don't wait the chance will pass you by
Time's up to figure it out
You can't say it's too late
Seems like everything we knew
Turned out were never even true
Don't trust things will never change
You must be dreaming
Think before you make up your mind
You don't seem to realise
I can do this on my own
And if I fall I'll take it all
It's so easy after all


Some say we're better off without
Knowing what life is all about
I'm sure they'll never realise the way

It's too late

Somehow it's different everyday
In some ways it never fades away
Seems like it's never gonna change
I must be dreaming
Think before you make up your mind
You don't seem to realise
I can do this on my own
Think before you make up your mind
You don't seem to realise

So what am I fighting for
Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go
I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready cause this is war
There are days that I think I’m crazy
Other days nothing seems to faze me
There’s nothing more and nothing less just
All the fears that I must confess well
I’m afraid I believe in nothing
No hopes or dreams you could’ve left me dead
Naive and not to mention
I’m losing count of all my blessings
With all that I’ve done, it’s too late
I can’t take back all that I have become
So all that I’m trying to say
I’m looking for a better way
Some days it just gets so hard
And I don’t wanna slip away
So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go
I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready cause this is war
Another day in the right direction
I’m ok but I’m left to question
How did I get so far behind the rest?
Why am I so inclined to forget?
All the days that you made me crazy
Nowadays you don’t even faze me
It’s all the same and I don’t stress none
Sick and tired of all this tension
With all that I’ve done, it’s too late I can’t take
Back all that I have become
So all that I’m trying to say
I’m looking for a better way
Some days it just gets so hard
And I don’t wanna slip away
So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go
I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready cause this is war. (x3)
All that I’m trying to say
I’m looking for a better way
Some days it just gets so hard
And I don’t wanna slip away
So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go
I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready cause this is war

Get ready cause this is warI tried to be perfect
But nothing was worth it
I don't believe it makes me real
I'd thought it'd be easy
But no on believes me
I meant all the things that I said
If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
that I'm trying to let you know
That I'm better off on my own
This place is so empty
My thoughts are so tempting
I don't know how it got so bad
Sometimes it's so crazy that nothing could save me
But it's the only thing that I have
If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
that I'm trying to let you know
That I'm better off on my own
（On my own!）
I tried to be perfect
It just wasn't worth it
Nothing could ever be so wrong
It's hard to believe me
It never gets easy
I guess I knew that all along
If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
that I'm trying to let you know
That I'm better off on my ownCome and join my voice in songs of love and death
Come and feel me, steal me, save me from myself
All my longing, wandering heart is yours to have
Come and join my voice in songs of love and death

Tonight we’ll start off our story told
From this day on we’ll watch our lives unfold
Kisses of fate on my shivering skin
You touch my heart and reach for the soul within

Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Come and feel me, steal me, save me from myself
All my longing, wandering heart is yours to have
Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Songs of love and death

Tonight our fortune will turn her wheel
I’ll close my eyes and listen to what I feel
And when the dawn breaks for you and me
Then we will turn to more than we both could be

Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Come and feel me, steal me, save me from myself
All my longing, wandering heart is yours to have
Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Songs of love and death

Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Come and feel me, steal me, save me from myself
All my longing, wandering heart is yours to have
Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Songs of love and deathAngel of death and mercy, come take me from this cage.
Cause these four walls and iron bars have been witness to the rage.
Of a thousand broken hearts in chains.
Like a cripple without his cane, a king without a crown.
The passion that once consumed me,
Has turned to ashes on the ground.
All that I've been given I give it to you.
I can't stand here watching you fail to tell the truth.
Somebody break these chains.
Wrapped around this heart.
I don't want you leaving,
I'm begging for mercy, oh to break these chains.
Oh heaven help me now,
Trade these shackles for a crown.
And I'm on my way, way down.
Warm the ice that fills my veins, pumping till I'm numb.
Lead me out of the darkness where it is so hard to escape from.
All that I've been given I give it to you.
I can't stand here watching you fail to tell the truth.
Somebody break these chains.
Wrapped around this heart.
I don't want you leaving,
I'm begging for mercy, oh to break these chains.
Oh heaven help me now,
Trade these shackles for a crown.
And I'm on my way, way down.
Listen
Bless my heart and bless my soul,
You can set my ass on fire.
Momma won't you call me a doctor
Cause my temperature rising higher and higher.
Dip me in that cold muddy water, I think I need to be saved.
Unless someone breaks these chains
All that I've been given I give it to you.
I can't stand here watching you fail to tell the truth.
Somebody break these chains.
Wrapped around this heart.
I don't want you leaving,
I'm begging for mercy, oh to break these chains.
Oh heaven help me now,
Trade these shackles for a crown.
And I'm on my wayFreedom la la la la

Let me tell you I'm vicious

Not pass-aggressive

I got my finger on my pulse staring
straight into a hole and I'ma get it

And I'm a savage

It's automatic

I got a way of making noise the power to destroy with no static

Now victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed

Hold your breath and count to ten just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain so ring the bell

I know it all too well

Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness witness
Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score

Don't be a casualty cut the cord
Freedom la la la la
Freedom follow me cut the cord

You gotta feel courage

Embrace possession

If it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered
But it's not because it's your obsession
Be a fighter backbone desire

Complicated and it stings but we both know what it means
And it's time to get real and inspired

Now victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten just count to ten just count to ten
I'm gonna make it rain so ring the bell

Freedom follow me me meTattooed are memories from home, 
Goodbyes are the only thing 
I know. (every time I leave it's not alright) 
Deep down 
I hope you understand, 
But this path is understood only by my own. 
Don't you sleep cause 
I can't sleep tonight. 
The time is obvious to me. 
Don't you sleep cause 
I can't sleep tonight. 
So stay up late, wait up for me. 
Why can't you wait when every night is not the end?  
The sun's been setting on the roadside, 
It's not the same here when you go. 
You're disappearing like the daylight, 
It's not the same here when you go. 
Twice told and 
I won't say again, 
When it's done 
I'm coming back to you, (cause you're the reason why I still come home). 
We got less then what we need, 
So lets make the best of every desperate dial tone. 
Don't you sleep cause 
I can't sleep tonight. 
The time is obvious to me. 
Don't you sleep cause 
I can't sleep tonight. 
So stay up late, wait up for me. 
Why can't you wait when every night is not the end?  
And this asphalt wont solve enough, 
Cause this road lacks human touch. 
But I believe the source that push away... 
It pulls me back to you.  
And my foot is gliding on the pedal all the way, 
My foot is gliding all the way.I felt my heart rate begin... to...
Choke out the ****ing noise like I was cursed
It felt like storms were directly overhead
And where I went it poured
And in a flash came the flood
That washed over my eyes
Now I could see inside the room of the blind
I lost myself inside
And as I fell into the black I left my past to die
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder
Is there anything we could have done
Why not try starting revolution,
And in the morning find a new sunrise?
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
As our world ignites
What will we do? Will we sit back and watch
I'm sick of apathy dictating how I think and how I
Talk, I'd like to know as I lay down to die
I still control the way I think, before they make up my mind
As I gaze up towards the sky
I feel lost in the world of the blinding lights
We all hope to reach these heights
But we're all so afraid of the fall
No one will take the fall
We're all so comfortable with living in our sheltered holes
No one will take the fall
But if we try to we could all change the world
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder
Is there anything we could have done
Why not try starting revolution
And in the morning find a new sunrise
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
As our world ignites
We are gathered here today as brothers and sisters not bound by fate, but by the understanding that our survival lies only in harmony.
We have only one life to live
And then were cast in to the night,
Will you carry a torch and be the keeper of the light?
Or will you let darkness fall?
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder
Is there anything
Is there anythingSo many reasons why one should never entertain the taste of the red.
A cry for a life of innocence escapes her.
So repent , and go running back because it might make it easier.
It's the scent of fear that keeps you chained down to the ritual.
Adhere.
You're a slave born into a dark world of deceit.
A slave that's longing for a retreat.

Learning to love a disaster.
Direct your soul in the essence of hate.
To draw the blood of the master ,
Flee.
The stains on your wings now carry the free.

Selfishly ,
Embrace the glory vengeance brings.
Hold courage tight.
Illuminate the light.

Punishment !
An eye for an eye , an knife for the wicked.
Just the sight of the organization burning to ashes
Will put a smile on her face.
The torture ends within this wretched place.
Oh please forgive what I've become.

Learning to love a disaster.
Direct your soul in the essence of hate.
To draw the blood of the master ,
Flee.
The stains on your wings now carry the

Golden seal
Extracted from the omen's life.
One steady hand in victory ,
Darkness weeps.
As love informs under a pure and present night
Born from the eye into the light.

So many reasons why one should never entertain the taste of scarlet.
Scarlet~~ !!

So many reasons why one should never entertain the taste of the red.
A cry for a life of innocence is key to

Learning to love a disaster.
Direct your soul in the essence of hate.
To draw the blood of the master ,
Flee.
The stains on your wings now carry the free.Light cloaks, shinning steel
Heavy armour, lethal swords
Mighty spirits, greedy souls
A white horse, carrying it all
Killing in the name of the god
Burn it into ashes and dust
Steal all gold in the power of the cross
Take all land, covert all souls
Killing in the name of the god
Burn it into ashes and dust
Steal all gold in the power of the cross
Take all land, covert all souls
They have their reason to take it all
To fatten up the holy church
They give to god - blood stained gold
Poor souls, no spirit at all
Castles and convents with mighty doors
Crimson drapes and thrones of oak
Halls of brave, glory and faith
Blessed by the god we raid again
They have their reason to take it all
To fatten up the holy church
They give to god - blood stained gold
Poor souls, no spirit at all作曲 : Trevor McNevan/Jeremy Michael Dunn/Jared Matthew Lankford/Jonathan David Jefferson/Jerry Adam Jefferson/Thomas Noah Terrell
How many people want to get this started?
From the front to the back, do you want it?
This life is never simple
And never quite serene
The sky is open but I can't believe it's open to me
This time I'm taking chances
The chances on a dream
This time I'll pick up the pieces
Never really thought that I could be this

No need to prove it, just lose it

You know who you are
Deep down in your heart
You've come so far
Don't you know the time is now or never
First day of the rest of your life forever
You know who you are
Deep down in your heart
You've come so far
Hold me back once, that's a warning
Hold me back again and you will be sorry
.
If I could take me somewhere
If I could find the means
If I could touch the things
I never thought would be in my reach
My time is leaving me here
No friend of mine it seems
So I will pick up the pieces
Never giving up since I can see this

.We begin the fall
of the Omega

generation

I'm left gasping for a breath of air
in this failing body and fading beauty

I reach for what was never there,
but I'm still reaching for some reason

Teach
me to navigate the stars
(and use the wind to guide my way)
If night and nature are my only hinderance
(then let me see the light of day)

Unheard of is the language that lured me in
It's deeper than the surface resting just beneath the

skin

Unheard of is the language
that lured me in

It's deeper than the surface resting just beneath the skin

Coated by the stratified soil
of my settlement I
dream of lives I've lost (and enduringly lament)
Unfinished pillars of our generation
personifying this falling nation
People and animals alike; the people are animals at night
Reverting back to their natural state when law was shapeless
and held no weight
We live in caves
buried in mountains
Stalactite supports without foundations
We are our fathers'bastard children,
evovled from cursed seed,
but we are not helpless
We will become the rebirth of hope
This steadfast campaign remains relentless

(We will remain relentless)

Unfinished pillars of our generation
personifying this falling nation
People and animals alike; the people are animals at night
Reverting back to their natural state when law was shapeless
and held no weight
We live in caves
buried in mountains
Stalactite supports without foundations

We begin the fall
of the Omega generation

Coalesence of Omega children,
take my hand The new world
begins

Unfinished pillars of our generation
(Reverting back to their natural state when law was shapeless and held no weight)
Personifying this falling nation

This voice, it spake
Tempted me to keep awake
Thus I realized
When there is no truth, there are no lies
Youre here, so sincere
To fathom the deepest fear
Misguide, this life
Away from truth, away from its line
Hey, away
Today is less painful than tomorrow here
Hey hey, this way
These words won't carry out a promise here
Hey, away
Today is less painful than tomorrow here
Hey hey, this way
These words won't carry out a promise here
This voice, now gone
My part here is finally done
Now I do realize
There was no truth, there were no lies
This greed to breathe
The will I am longing to wreathe
No words, no lies
All foul will last, all beautiful dies
Hey, away
Today is less painful than tomorrow here
Hey hey, this way
These words won't carry out a promise here
Hey, away
Today is less painful than tomorrow here
Hey hey, this way
These words won't carry out a promise here
A dream, a nightmare
A spasm of fleeting joy
So sincere, enchanting
A spasm of tempting void
Awaken, words taken
All hollow, so shallow
These words have no meaning
These words carry out no truth here
A spasm of tempting void
A dream, a nightmare
A spasm of fleeting joy
So sincere, enchanting
Awaken, words taken
All hollow, so shallow
These words have no meaning
These words carry out no truth here
Hey, away
Today is less painful than tomorrow here
Hey hey, this way
These words won't carry out a promise here
Hey, away
Today is less painful than tomorrow here
Hey hey, this way
These words won't carry out a promise hereYou can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down
I'm good, I'm fine, this life divine
No hate, no shame, no one to blame
You might despise your life
Realize I won't chastise
Even if you think you can bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I riding down the spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me
Down Down Down Down Down
You won't ever bring me
Down Down Down Down Down
You won't ever bring me
I can't escape from your disdain
Your heart, your pain, your drama is lame
Why can't you find some peace inside?
I won't chastise
Even when you think you can bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I'm riding down the spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me

You won't ever bring me downAll my thoughts are useless,
They keep me from seeing the bright light.
Falling down this well now,
I’m reaching but it’s too high.
Is this the end, the fall of man?
Did we take nothing from the meaning of
Change for the masses? We’re never gonna learn.
If all we do is take, take, no return.
Blame it on the outside, close the curtains.
Dare me to explain why we don’t deserve
The land that we fill and the blood that they spilt
Not a selfish intention; an order to kill.
Kill, kill, kill
Ourselves with the question,
Destroy or rebuild?
Singing SOS to ourselves.
All my thoughts are useless,
They keep me from seeing the bright light.
Falling down this well now,
I’m reaching but it’s too high.
It’ll take a hurricane,
To clean up all the mess we made.
If we’re gonna fly this flag of peace,
We’ll need you.
We need to dig this up from the roots
And if a god’s looking down we’ll give them something to lose.
We’ll give them something to lose.
Assailants; second nature hypocrites.
Tell me that it’s not as bad as it may seem.
Surviving this death trap by the skin of our teeth,
Oxygen thieves. Are we just Oxygen thieves?
This is survival of the sickest.
We’re the casualties that keep living
The same shit over and over again
The end is coming
The end is coming
It’ll take a hurricane,
To clean up all the mess we made.
If we’re gonna fly this flag of peace,
We’ll need you.
It’ll take a hurricane,
To clean up all the mess we made.
If we’re gonna fly this flag of peace,
We’ll need you.
We need to dig this up from the roots
And if a god’s looking down we’ll give them something to lose.
All my thoughts are useless,
They keep me from seeing the bright light.

I’m reaching but it’s too high.作曲 : Mäenpää
For years I have travelled in coldness,
but my heart is warm as the darkened sun above me...
Nothing can ever take away
what I've seen with these tired eyes
Face of the weeping night
and the shade of the fading light
Face of the weeping night
The dawn will never rise again for my eyes
and I will never sleep again
I've lost my hope time after time
cause the light has vanished from the sky
Now when the darkness has become part of me
I got to let my shadows free
cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
something that could have made me one
Now when the sorrow has taken control of me
I got to let my shadows free
cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
something that could have made me one
something that I could reach the SunTrue freedom deep within, this agony is not a sin
Inside these walls I'm captured in
Blood dripping through my eyes, my life carries so many lies
Thou shall fall, who shall rise
If you see how these chains I have
Make me feel like I was born to die
If you hear my voice screaming out loud
Please come save me before it's too late
If you see how these chains I have
Make me feel like I was born to die
If you hear my voice screaming out loud
Please come save me before it's too late
This soul is never sold, I keep only the trust of my own
My soul, my cell, I'm a prisoner in myself
Tonight oh, my Lord so, I would like to flee from me
This isn't real, take this pain away
If you see how these chains I have
Make me feel like I was born to die
If you hear my voice screaming out loud
Please come save me before it's too late
This soul is never sold, I keep only the trust of my own
My soul, my cell, I'm a prisoner in myself
Tonight oh, my Lord so, I would like to flee from me
This isn't real, take this pain awayBlinded by a betrayel scene,
No one there to keep my trust
All these serpents in my head,
make me see what I must
Scarred heart and wounded mind
My own blood now stains my hands
Fueled with rage, to stand and fight,
I will be the last who stands
Haunted by a murder scene,
My weakness was my only hope
Broken alliance, broken trust,
From now on I live for myself
Battered heart and hollow mind,
My revenge became my world
I regret not things I've done,
Alone I stand, still I hurt
I have no love for life anymore,
I no longer believe in the world
Put your life in the hands of another
And you sure will lose it all
I will not break down and crumble,
Now that I've found my strength
Show me the error of my ways,
And I will laugh at your face
I will not give in and stumble
Now that I see right through you
Try to make me change my way
And I'll show you the reasons why
I have no love for life anymore,
I no longer believe in the world
Put your life in the hands of another
And you sure will lose it all
I will not break down and crumble,
Now that I've found my strength
Show me the error of my ways,
And I will laugh at your faceWe are the chosen ones,
we sacrifice our blood
We kill for honour
We are the holy ones our armours stained with blood
We killed the dragon
In glory we return, our destination's end
We slayed the dargon!
No more living in fear it's time to raise our king.
We made it happen we're the chosen ones!
Riding through thunder and lighting once again
We slayed the beast we brought an end
Now we have left the kingdom of the damned
Heroes of the day, legends forever!
It seems to me like a journey without end
So many years, too many battles
We've finally arrived, now we're standing at the gates
Heroes of the day, legends forever作曲 : Disturbed
Fading,falling,lost  in  forever
Am  I  strong  enough  to  last  through  the  weather  in  the  hurricane  of  my  life?
Will  I  find  a  way  to  keep  it  together?
Can  it  be  a  conscious  decision?
That  I  look  for  ways  to  alter  my  vision?
Am  I  speeding  towards  another  collision  in  the  alleyways  of  my  life?

Don't  stand  me  up
Just  leave  me
I  have  fallen  again
This  is  the  end
Pain  redefined
Shaking,burning  up  with  the  fever
In  the  realm  of  pain,I  am  the  deceiver
Now  I  lie  to  myself,so  I  can  believe  her
As  she  dissembles  my  life
I  cannot  dispel  the  illusion
All  my  hopes  and  dreams  are  drowned  by  confusion
Can  I  find  a  way  to  make  a  solution  that  will  reconfigure  my  life?
Memories  don't  lie
You  know  better  than
Memories  don't  lie
You  know  better  than

Don't  stand  me  up
Just  leave  me
I  have  fallen  again
This  is  the  end
Pain  redefined
And  I  know  that  stillness  shatters
We  have  all  been  frightened  by  the
The  sound  of  footsteps  on  the  pavement  of  our  lives
I  stand  and  fight
I'm  not  afraid  to  die
Elochai,bury  me  tonight
Please  believe  me
That  the  world  decieves  me
Don't  stand  me  up
Just  leave
I  have  fallen  again
This  is  the  end
Pain  redefinedI've been trap inside my head
Feeling like there's nothing left
The silence, takes over
Holding on to my regrets
Choking down a cigaret
The ending, gets closer
Pressure is building
The struggle begin
Break, break from the dark
Free from the shadows
All of this pain is left me now
It rapes me apart
To suffer in silence
Escaping the monster I've become

I just need some piece of mine
All the scars are reason why
My heart is so empty
Try to leave it all behind
Find a way to make it right
I'm looking but can't see
Pressure is building
The struggle begin
Break, break from the dark
Free from the shadows
All of this pain is left me now
It rapes me apart
To suffer in silence
Escaping the monster I've become

Break, break from the dark
Free from the shadows
All of this pain is left me now
It rapes me apart
To suffer in silence
Escaping the monster I've become
Break from the dark
Free from the shadows
All of this pain is left me now
It rapes me apart
To suffer in silence
Escaping the monster I've become

Escaping the monster I've become
Escaping the monster I've becomeHail -- Hail to the Gods
That our ancestors praised in the woods
Skald -- Narrate us the tale
Of the God with sorrow in his heart
Tell us his fears
Odin the great sits enthroned Hlidskialf
Looking down to Midgard in deep grief
Tears in the eye you wouldn't believe it
Tears in the eye of the great God
See the fall of Odin's warriors
Snow keeps falling in this frozen land
Hail -- Hail to the Gods
That our ancestors saw in the skies
Snow -- Coating the land
Endless darkness rises from now
No more light
Tears in the eye you wouldn't believe it
Tears in the eye of the great God
See the fall of Odin's warriors
Snow keeps falling in this frozen land
Under the oak we used to meet
To praise the Gods of forgotten times
Now it stands alone in the forest glade
The Whipping winds tear if the leaves
No one sees the fading tree
It passes away from the light of day
Odin the great sits enthroned Hlidskialf
Looking down to Midgard in deep grief
Tears in the eye you wouldn't believe it
Tears in the eye of the great God
See the fall of Odin's warriors
Snow keeps falling in this frozen land作词作曲：Phil Bozeman, Alex Wade, Ben Savage.
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise
Get out of my head
Someone save me from this madness
I'd rather be dead
All I see is reality
Fabricated by something I refuse to see
You know who I am
You created me by letting yourself believe
Take my cold dead hands
And go six feet down
Your failure is found
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
From this self-imprisoned, self-made hell
Don't be surprised, this is your mind
Coming to life by self-sacrifice
This tragedy of death will walk hand in hand
With every thought of regret
Blame yourself for what you've become
The mind is a powerful thing set to self-destruct
Mind-****ed
Mind-****ed
Mind-****ed
You had your chance
Your time
This is the end of the line
This is the end of the line
This is the end

I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise
We will slowly rot until this is stopped.Bland skuggor rider en odjur.
Som en svarta träd.
Griper hård på en mäktig hammar.
Ut för svaga kristna blod.

Trollhammaren sveper igen!
Hugga ned, broder igen!
Hör det sista ropet -
Trollhammaren är här!

Han är inte en människa.
Inte bräcklig och svag som dig.
Du ska vara maktlös.
Inga ögon ser din änd.

Sedan mörkret övertog.
Räds den frostens kalla fingrar.
Som griper tag och förlever.
Under kommande vinternatt.

TROLLHAMMAREN!I saw a dream that can't be real
It takes me to my mind
Now look inside this evil dream of mine
I left you dying in the rain
Now you feel my ****ing pain
You know I am insane but in the end it's all the same
IN THIS DREAM
I AM ONLY REAL
TAKE MY HAND AND FLYWITH ME AGAIN TONIGHT
FAR AWAY IN THE SHINING MOONLIGHT
WE ARE FOREVERAND TOGETHER WE WILL DIEEEEEE！
Now you are dead and gone
I won't cry no more for you
I don't know why
I'm going on
Now I am turning back for you you are dead, it's all so true
After all this dream was real now it's only pain I feel
IN THIS DREAM
I AM ONLY REAL
TAKE MY HAND AND FLYWITH ME AGAIN TONIGHT
FAR AWAY IN THE SHINING MOONLIGHT
WE ARE FOREVERAND TOGETHER WE WILL DIEEEEEE！Why has it all changed?
What have we lost? What have we gained?
Nothing of this will ever remain
Only a bunch of child’s memories
Why has it all changed?
What have I lost? and what have you gained?
Nothing of this will ever remain
Only a bunch of child’s memories
Hidden in shame

We used to stay together
Dreaming of what we’d have become
We’d have been friends forever
What should I say now that you’re gone?
Through my eyes you’re fading
This is the way I feel
Why has it all changed?
What have we lost? What have we gained?
Nothing of this will ever remain
Only a bunch of child’s memories
Why has it all changed?
What have I lost? and what have you gained?
Nothing of this will ever remain
Only a bunch of child’s memories
I miss those times when we played as kids

No worries about our future, no enemies
Now I close my eyes
Trying to go back then with my mind
Oh, how I wish we could live the old times again
Through my eyes you're fading

This is the way I feel

We can’t stand here waiting
Why are we afraid if there’s nothing but time between us
We can’t stand here waiting
Nothing is changing
Will we ever meet again?

Will we ever meet again?
What are we waiting for?
What are we so afraid of?Would you give me the key to the empire of bliss

Problems of the deepest kind
Knife is on the table and noose attached
Bottle is open but the misery remains
There are things they couldn't know
Friends all gathered he is still alone
Atrocities that followed carved a
Cross to heavy to bear
Darkness grew greater every single day
Behind that friendly yet empty stare
Investigations have been open
Since she left us far behind
We wonder why she is longer around
Some say she has crossed the borderline

There are things they couldn't know
Friends all gathered he is still alone
Chill is felt when passing the chair that
Moth-bitten blanket hid
Stairway down to the invisible one still
Unfixed like the trace of the struggle

Weep your sobbing won't affect me now
Sufferit is merely music to my hears
Turn your back on me
Is that the best move you could do
Pretending is over now
I don't give a f**k about you
Atrocities that followed carved a
Cross to heavy to bear
Darkness grew greater every single
Day behind that friendly yet empty stare
Investigations have been open
Since she left us far behind
We wonder why she is longer around
Some say she has crossed the borderline
We won't see her ever againThere lived a certain man in Russia, long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame, how he carried on
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen, he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed, he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son
repeat
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
For power became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about
This outrageous man became louder and louder
"This man's just got to go", declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night, some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us", they kept demanding
And he really came
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and said, "I feel fine"
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead
Oh, those Russians作词 : Bolan, Sabo
Ricky was a young boy, He had a heart of stone.
Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone.
Just barely got out of school, came from the edge of town.
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down.
He had no money, oooh no good at home.
He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone

Tequila in his heartbeat, His veins burned gasoline.
It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean.
They say he loved adventure, "Ricky’s the wild one."
He married trouble and had a courtship with a gun.
Bang Bang Shoot ’em up, The party never ends.
You can’t think of dying when the bottle’s your best friend
And now it’s

He fired his six-shot to the wind that blew a child away.

I stood and took the place of all that emptiness
You said that you never thought god existed
But someone had to answer
To coincidences
So we'll just play it safe
And we'll forget that we ever had any questions
I said I'd give you everything I had
When I had nothing left
but I might just bring you down
I went from filling to becoming all that emptiness
that I saw inside you
And I would stay if I could just learn to shut my mouth
Cause everything I said just makes it so much worse
I work my hands down the bone
So everything I touch just feels like stone
Well, yeah, I sold myself short
You don't need me
No one does
Because I'm nothing to no one
I don't care if I make it
I'm stranded，I'm nowhere
I'm straight up sinking
I'm not letting anyone bother trying to patch these leaks
There's nothing to hold
Nothing to keep
My ship has sailed
I got stranded before the storm took over
There's only one way out
I was so tempted to give in a head for clearer weather
There's only one way out
And it's the hardest one to take
Because I'm nothing to no one
I don't care if I make it
I'm stranded，I'm nowhere
I'm straight up sinking
I'm not letting anyone bother trying to patch these leaks
There's nothing to hold
There's nothing to keep
And I prayed every single night before I slept
And now there's just no one to talk to

Темный огонь,
Светлая тьма
Где же та грань, что не можем найти
Все перешло
В один страшный сон
И чем дальше идем, тем труднее спастись..
За пеленою из грязи и фальши
Не упустить бы того, чем дышу
Лишь сердцем любовь, в глубине ощущая,
Я понимаю, что все еще я живу...You're beautiful Innocence. I want you
It's no longer a dream about you
For you my soul. Your flesh for me
God inside you. Devil inside me
Devil inside me
When the waves of night embrace my dreams
I call your name
You're the innocent child. I'm your dark prince
Enjoy this game.
You're beautiful innocence. I want you
I want you
Bound in black, leads to abuse
Leads to abuse
Let me kiss your lips and your face, your pretty face
You take me in your sweet embrace
Your sweet embrace
You're beautiful innocence. I want you
I want you
Lay down on a bed and I'll sleep with you
I'll sleep with you
For you my dreams
Your life for me
Life for me
God inside you. Devil inside me
Devil inside me
When the waves of night embrace my dreams
I call your name
You're the innocent child. I'm your dark prince

I saw her standing by the crimson sea...
Her gazing was intense but so dead...
The teardrops corroded the soil...
She couldn't say a word to me...

I know I want to be the young bride of the crimson sea
I'm here to join the dark waves on this sacred night
I know I must return my heart to the Gods of the seas
to become the maiden of those crimson skies

Isolated by the silent thoughts...
They were too strong for her mind...
Misguided by the burning desires...
She couldn't resist them at all...

I know I want to be the young bride of the crimson sea
I'm here to join the dark waves on this sacred night
I know I must return my heart to the Gods of the seas
to become the maiden of those crimson skies

I heard her whispers of remorse...
Her naive mind was much too weak...
Her fragile soul was hurt by the night too black...
All she wanted was to be a part of the sea...

A body with a heartless convention
A face with a smile thats been shut down for years
Facing the facts of my generation...cause

I might as well get another life cause Ive been there
I know whats been said and I know whats been done
Dont you tell me Im the only one, cause i...

I will be there looking for something
Coming straight out of nothing, just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
I really am waiting for nothing
Coming straight out of something, just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile

Now put your trust in a solid machine
Filled with words that have never been seen
A plague to insatiable souls left to die
Charged with mankinds raw energy
I rumble, I stumble
My memory starts to crumble
I cant refuse whats haunting my dreams
Have I stumbled?
On my way to a created perfection
I penetrate the gates of rejection

I will be there looking for something
Coming straight out of nothing, just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
I really am waiting for nothing
Coming straight out of something, just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile

Theres no determination, echoes of a failed gallery
Theres yet extermination, inside us all screaming

So goddamn easy to write this,
You make it spill on the page.
So drunk on yourself, self-righteous,
The laughing stock of your own ******* sage.

But I ain't one to call names,
Or throw stones in a house of glass.
You try me.

This is a mother******* invitation
The only one you could ever need.
This is a mother******* invitation.
You try me.

Just one time you got a reason,
Heard you had nothing to lose.
A pied preacher for the pin-eyed congregation,
It must be easy to lose.

But I ain't one of those names,
Or throw stones in a house of glass.
You try me.

This is a mother******* invitation
The only one you could ever need.
This is a mother******* invitation.
You try me.

You can tell the same lie a thousand times,
But it never gets anymore true,
So close your eyes once more and once more believe
That they all still believe in you.

Just one time.

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine

Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts fo steel
Evils going under deadly wheels

He is the Painkiller

This is the Painkiller

Faster than a lazer bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns

Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind ressurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies

He is the Painkiller

Wings of steel Painkiller

I am no longer confused

Got to pay rent

Slipping through my hands
I'm working with these hands
Little Johnny needs a lunch box
Little Susy needs clothes & it won't stop
Banks calling us up
And they don't care
It's more then I can bare
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine
I... I'm at the edge of my life
I got no time to think twice
When I'm standing with the weight
Of the world on my shoulders
I... I'm gonna fight the good fight
Cause i, I know I'll get by
When I battle every day through the pain
Like a soldier

Mom crying on the sofa
Dad comes home but he's not sober
Where'd the family go
Up in smoke again
Feels just like sinking sand
Heard shouts in the backyard (hey)
Sirens ringing from a cop car
It's a rough day
For this family man
I'm praying with these hands
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine
I... I'm at the edge of my life
I got no time to think twice
When I'm standing with the weight
Of the world on my shoulders
I... I'm gonna fight the good fight
Cause I, I know I'll get by
When I battle every day through the pain
Like a soldier

Just don't look down
And you'll never fall
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
I... I'm at the edge of my life
I got no time to think twice
When I'm standing with the weight
Of the world on my shoulders
I... I'm gonna fight the good fight
Cause I, I know I'll get by
When I battle every day through the pain
Like a soldierSomethings haven taken over who I am.
I went cold finding my way back.
Places only seen by ones will want to be.
Lost consumes masses of a dying breed.
Hammered through life a nail to seal this demise.
This light will show forever and a day.

This is where I want to be.
Where there's comfort in everything.
This is where I want to be.
I have made it here from nothing.
No recognition of who you are.
Don't you see this is where I want to be.
Your only making excuses to hide what the truth is.

Your only making a fool of yourself.

Unthought out excuses.

This is where I want to be.
Where there's comfort in everything.
This is where I want to be.
I have made it here from nothing.

This is where I want to be.
I have made it here from nothing.
This is where I want to be.
I have made it here from nothing.
This is where I want to be.
But this is only half way there.
this is where i want to be
i have made it here form nothingBlowing cold!
The sound of the wind lets see silent presence of every thing.
Wary steps of drawing near, decisive silence, restless breath...
Would-be angelhood, sucking out lifeblood drop by drop.
I feel your hand on me. Your touch is wrong.
Blood on your arms... You won't see till bury with your own hands.
Blood in your mouth... Tasted once you'll have no strength to stop.
Chokehold! Warm flow you drink in wastes me. It's easier...
To scramble out of the grave than to tear myself from your embrace.
There's no way to hide from you, there's no sense to run away.
You retrieve me to the place where steps of hopelessness begin. Just make me dead...
Spit blood...
I feel your skin, I feel your hand on me. Touching to kiss...
It's not like you're gonna care.
You drown in my blood your tears and sorrow. You want more and more... Are you not blood drunk yet?
Give me your hand to show you my pain somewhere... Give me one more chance to die... Take me out!
Let carry out my desire, just mortify. Leave me alone forever! ...
My desire, I let you kill. Leave me alone forever!
Red drips, warm sweet blood streams you drink... I feel cold kiss, taste of bloodred lips...
Chokehold, dead set to belong to you. I suffocate and you breathe...
Goodbye, I gasp out to you. It's the time for death kiss...
I feel your skin, I feel your hand on me. Touching to kiss...
It's not like you're gonna care.
You drown in my blood your tears and sorrow. You want more and more... Are you not blood drunk yet?
Give me your hand to show you my pain somewhere... Give me one more chance to die... Take me out!
Let carry out my desire, just mortify. Leave me alone forever! ...
Day by day I look like increasingly my future corpse. Wounding, you suck my wounds, gore, sore.
I could bury myself, but my hands are tied with rope. I bleed on the floor, no more hope. Red is your color.This everflowing stream
Disappears without a trace
That everglowing dream
Never worth the lengthy chase
Not follow me
The leader of exploration
I'm the one that you obey
Command the chain into perfection
End your days in victory
Inspiration high
For the mission possible
Desperation low
For falling fathers
On your broken ribs
Behold the second coming
Since we drew the first breath
Sweetheart
We're in control for operation
Everblack...
Narrow minded ignorants
Come that way, I'll raise the flag
Hear them all forever chanting
Everblack
Picture this
The impact of soldiers blazing
Like a deadly tidal wave
A sight that's so amazing
It surely takes your breath away
Mass hysteria
We love the feeling
Monumentally
Extremely arise
Like the crescent moon
That speaks to me
Behold the second coming
Since we drew the first breath
Sweetheart
We're in control for operation
Everblack...
Narrow minded ignorants
Come that way, I'll raise the flag
Hear the whole world chanting
Everblack
The future is now or never
A phase to overcome
Mercenary lives forever
We'll conquer one by one
Purple heart
The metal of honour is chosen
For the ones that slay the weak
Our mission everblasting
This evergrowing dream
Ddestination bittersweet
Disappears without a trace
Forever flowing steram
Runnung deep inside my veins

We're the brothers of slaughter
Operation EverblackRunning under cover of the moonlight
Shadow death row.At the night we're
Running wild with no hope for tomorrow...
No tomorrow!!!

A glance to the blaze of pain

Can I really care enough
If you never cared at all?

It's not the first
And it wont be the last
I'm an addict for a dramatic life
It's written in my past

'Cause I've seen that part of you
Where I found the bitter truth
There's nowhere left to hide
That could save this life
So I'll say goodbye to you

Wherever you are
You break and you scar
You'll never get the best of me
You'll never get that far

As you're breaking down
With no one around
Think of how you got that way
Remember who you are

'Cause I've seen that part of you
Where I found the bitter truth
There's nowhere left to hide
That could save this life
So I'll say goodbye to you

I've seen that part of you
Where I saw the bitter truth

In airs and graces
Your changing faces
I see it in everyone
See it in everything
Don't stand a chance in sobriety
I can't escape you when I drink
My entire being it swells and retracts
When I think of
How you went behind my back

You finally found the guts
To keep it honest for once
Remember every lie
Forget the family you gave up
'Cause I've seen that part of you
Where I found the bitter truth
There's nowhere left to hide
That could save this life
So I'll say goodbye to you作词 : Butler, Dio, Iommi, Ward
Heaven  And  Hell -BLACK  SABBATH
Sing  me  a  song,you're  a  singer
Do  me  a  wrong,you're  a  bringer  of  evil
The  Devil  is  never  a  maker.The  less  that  you  give,you're  a  taker.
So  it's  on  and  on  and  on,it's  Heaven  and  Hell,oh  well
The  lover  of  life's  not  a  sinner
The  ending  is  just  a  beginner
The  closer  you  get  to  the  meaning
The  sooner  you'll  know  that  you're  dreaming
So  it's  on  and  on  and  on,oh  it's  on  and  on  and  on
It  goes  on  and  on  and  on,Heaven  and  Hell.
I  can  tell,fool!fool!
Well  if  it  seems  to  be  real,it's  illusion
For  every  moment  of  truth,there's  confusion  in  life ,
Love  can  be  seen  as  the  answer,
but  nobody  bleeds  for  the  dancer
And  it's  on  and  on,on  and  on  and  on....
They  say  that  life's  a  carousel
Spinning  fast,you've  got  to  ride  it  well
The  world  is  full  of  Kings  and  Queens
Who  blind  your  eyes  and  steal  your  dreams
It's  Heaven  and  Hell,oh  well
And  they'll  tell  you  black  is  really  white
The  moon  is  just  the  sun  at  night
And  when  you  walk  in  golden  halls
You  get  to  keep  the  gold  that  falls
It's  Heaven  and  Hell,oh  no!
Fool,fool!
You've  got  to  bleed  for  the  dancer!Fool,fool!
Look  for  the  answer!
Fool,fool,fool!无歌词无歌词Hey Mister' where have you been

I''ll never get to live this life again

I gave it all but you were never there

I gave it all but did you really ever care

I hope where you are is a home for you
Because I never found mine
While I was always looking for you
Hey Mister' where have you been

I''ll never get to live this life again

Hey! Live it up
Where are you this time

You never showed' I''ll never know
How could you just let me go

I''m all alone but you can''t feel that

Look at me now' now I''ve become
Become the man you''ll never know

This is the anthem for all you cowards

This is the anthem for you cowards

Cowards

Hey Mister' where have you been

I''ll never get to live this life again

I just don''t see it eye to eye anymore
You were too much for me to ignore
This search has been full of so many tears
That flooded the future I saw' discovering you
Hey Mister' where have you been

I''ll never get to live this life again

Hey! Live it up
Where are you this time

You never showed' I''ll never know
How could you just let me go
I''m all alone but you can''t feel that

Look at me now' now I''ve become
Become the man you''ll never know

This is what I got.

I don''t need you anymore!
This is what I got.
I don''t need you anymore!
This is what I got.
I don''t need you anymore!
This is what I got.
I don''t need you!Oh yeah!
Some people say my love cannot be true
please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
forever with me 'till the end of time
Your love for me has just got to be real
before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
Oh yeah!
Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you will see who I am
my name is Lucifer, please take my hand
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
forever with me 'till the end of time

Your love for me has just got to be real
before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
Oh yeah!
Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you will see who I am
my name is Lucifer, please take my handFinished with my woman 'cause
she couldn't help me with my mind
people think that I'm insane
because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things
but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?

Oh yeah yeah oh yeah

I need someone to show me the things
in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness,
I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh
and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I can not feel
so love to me us so unreal

And so as you hear these
words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late

it's too late too late

Nick Nick Nick For me ridenEvery day the pain comes back again
The grief that tightens it's grip, day by day
Loneliness it haunts me, makes me cry
Feels like the world has abandoned me
I'm weak, I'm nothing, just a shadow of my life
My heart is dead and still I dream of you
Don't you understand you're the reason for my pain
I hear you calling me to come
There's no-one I can see
Just the nights cold breeze
Oh god I'm so alone, so alone
I fear the darkness that makes me blind
There's nothing I can feel
These tears are nothing without you
I'm nothing without you
Can you see my heart, broken like my life
Nothing to hold on, nothing to live for
This pain is too much for me to take
Holding on to you was like holding on to nothing
My trust for you tore me apart
I gave all for you from my heart
I fear the darkness that makes me blind
There's nothing I can feel
These tears are nothing without you
I'm nothing without you
Can you see my heart, broken like my life
Nothing to hold on, nothing to live for
This pain is too much for me to take
Holding on to you was like holding on to nothing
Can you see my heart, broken like my life
Nothing to hold on, nothing to live for
This pain is too much for me to take
Holding on to you was like holding on to nothingThis world can’t hold us,
you can’t mess with soldiers
There’s no cell big enough to hold us
We came to be a wrecking ball to these boulders
Know this, I ain’t scared ofthese cobras
Over time, they’ve tried to just fold us
They thought they could mess with this focus
But there’s no room for these locusts
‘Cause real faith’s beliefwithout borders
Hold this
We yell, but no one hears
We persevere,
as we approach the line
We march,
for all those fears, that kept us here
This time they’re left behind
Acting like they don’t notice
But they’re just mad because they can’t mold us
Told you never underestimate soldiers
Cause you can build a thousand walls
You can’t hold us
If we just keep running away
We’ll never make it alive
Until we stand and we fight
Aim, fire, and blow it away
We’re storming enemy lines
Leaving no one behind
This rock can’t hold us
‘Cause the light has shown us
No fear’s big enough to own us
We were never meant to fit in these folders
Know this, I ain’t scared ofthese posers
Over time we all face opponents
They thought they could mess with this focus
They forgot, the end ofthe climb’s the coldest, known as
Life’s a battlefield ofmoments, hold this
We yell, but no one hears
We persevere,
as we approach the line
We march,
for all those fears, that kept us here
This time they’re left behind
Acting like they don’t notice
But they’re just mad because they can’t mold us
Told you never underestimate soldiers
Cause you can build a thousand walls
You can’t hold us
If we just keep running away
We’ll never make it alive
Until we stand and we fight
Aim, fire, and blow it away
We’re storming enemy lines
Leaving no one behind
If we just keep running away
We’ll never make it alive
Until we stand and we fight
Aim, fire, and blow it away
We’re storming enemy lines
Leaving no one behind
If we just keep running away
We’ll never make it alive
Until we stand and we fight
Aim, fire, and blow it away
We’re storming enemy lines
Leaving no one behind作曲 : Veland
If  you  were  here
I'd  whisper  sweet  nothings  in  your  ear
And  appeal  to  all  your  fears
If  you  were  mine,（if  you  were  only  mine ）
I'd  bring  you  so  much  further  down
And  twist  your  mind  until  the  end  of  time
You  will  never  realize
What  darkness  lies  inside （inside）my  mind
If  you  are  down
I  will  come  to  chain  you  to  the  ground
And  penetrate  your  mind
If  you  are  lost,（if  only  you  are  lost ）
I'll  be  there  to  break  you  trust
And  ravage  all  your  lust  for  life,my  love
You  will  never  realize
What  darkness  lies  inside （inside）my  mind
inside  my  mindOut of the sea onto the shore there came a story
About a tear and a smile made of glory
Moved a heart reached the sun and somehow thereby
You came far on your run through the gardens
Dreadful hours in the storm and the night refused to glow
Your hope was never fading away though they didn't let you go
A final walk with your head up high and a sun that said goodbye
A rose against an army of pain and they didn't see you cry
Hard to kneel on the ground but he is quite close
He can even be found in your white rose
Answers to questions that most only dared to whisper
You spoke out - tears are proud - courages sister
Dreadful hours in the storm and the night refused to glow
Your hope was never fading away though they didn't let you go
A final walk with your head up high and a sun that said goodbye
A rose against an army of pain and they didn't see you cry
But soon you will rise - oh from the dark
As you faced their violence you defeated
No more drifting away - hold on to the spark!
You can grow in silence when you feel it
When you feel it
Once more turn around - around
Before they lay you down!
And soon you will rise with wings of freedom in peace
No more drifting away - upright and straight
You will bloom in absence
Somehow you will stay
Somehow you will stay
The way she suffered that is the tear
The smile will forever be her idea
Something survived - something she chose
Don't say goodbye to that soft white rose!This is our way of life
And we sleep away our misery in our blood-soaked sheets
We’ve left our homes to infect the world and addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars, infinite blood to bleed
Our presence stops your heart and leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees and recognize your new found king
Where we come from, the saw is the law
When there’s no hope left, we will not fall
Among the giants, we still stand tall and we will not be stopped
Just let it go and let the wind blow
It’s like a hurricane inside your head
The pressure’s never ending but your brain is still depending and comprehending why it is still defending just let
go and be one with the family
Your life decisions have become our control and we will swallow this world whole
You are, you are nothing
We are everything, you are nothing without us
This is our way of life
Taking cities one by one
Carefully choose your side
You could be one of many sons
This is our way of life
Deafening ears and shutting mouths
Come and join our side
Welcome to the deep south
This is our way of life
We’ve left our homes to infect the world and addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars, infinite blood to bleed

Against the waves,
with our swords in our hands
Against the sea,
with our backs to the walls
Against distress,
in the presence of our enemies
Against the storms,
roaring at our faces
A cry rang out throughout the skies
A beckon,
the flight of the cranes
The call of the mountains
The call of the Alps
The call home
The tune in our hearts
The song of the mountains
What's that stir,
so blatant in our sallying hearts?
What's that urge,
that lifted up our longing eyes?
What's that ring,
echoing from the leaden skies?
What's that augur,
resounding from the lyre's strings?
A cry rang on in the sibilant winds
A behest,
the outcry of the cranes
The call of the mountains
The call of the Alps
The call home
The tune in our hearts
The song of the mountains
the voice of the wind
the sound of the sky
The call of the mountains
The call of the Alps
The call home
The tune in our hearts

The call of the Alps
The call home

Medusa, oh, she's cold
Medusa
SOLO
Endless curse, blood runs cold
Evil stare, will turn your flesh to stone
Land of doom, world of sin
All subside, don't venture near
The island where she lives
Oh, she'll suck you in
Destroyer of life, Demon
Oh I'm ready to strike, Gorgon
Medusa, she's staring at you
Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa, oh, she's coldNuapurista kuulu se polokan tahti
jalakani pohjii kutkutti.
Ievan äiti se tyttöösä vahti
vaan kyllähän Ieva sen jutkutti,
sillä ei meitä silloin kiellot haittaa
kun myö tanssimme laiasta laitaan.

Ievan suu oli vehnäsellä
ko immeiset onnee toevotti.
Peä oli märkänä jokaisella
ja viulu se vinku ja voevotti.
Ei tätä poikoo märkyys haittaa
sillon ko laskoo laiasta laitaan.

Ievan äiti se kammarissa
virsiä veisata huijjuutti,
kun tämä poika naapurissa
ämmän tyttöä nuijjuutti.
Eikä tätä poikoo ämmät haittaa
sillon ko laskoo laiasta laitaan.
Eikä tätä poikoo ämmät haittaa
sillon ko laskoo laiasta laitaan.

Siellä oli lystiä soiton jäläkeen
sain minä kerran sytkyyttee.
Kottiin ko mäntii ni ämmä se riitelj
ja Ieva jo alako nyyhkyytteek.
Minä sanon Ievalle mitäpä se haittaa
Minä sanon Ievalle mitäpä se haittaa

Muorille sanon jotta tukkee suusi
en ruppee sun terveyttäs takkoomaa.
Terveenä peäset ku korjoot luusi
ja määt siitä murjuus makkoomaa.
Ei tätä poikoo hellyys haittaa
ko akkoja huhkii laiasta laitaan.
Ei tätä poikoo hellyys haittaa
ko akkoja huhkii laiasta laitaan.

Sen minä sanon jotta purra pittää
ei mua niin voan nielasta.
Suat männä ite vaikka lännestä ittään
vaan minä en luovu Ievasta,
sillä ei tätä poikoo kainous haittaa
sillon ko tanssii laiasta laitaan.

Inside you know that I'll be waiting
First crawl to see that you can make it
They say that you're the one with what it
Takes to brave this world of darkness

Encounters with many beasts you've not seen
Tricks and traps leave your head spinning
Nightmare fuel that keeps you running
Shadows crawling on the ceiling
Home where ghosts dwell; hope you slept well

Sisters, we need to gather 'round him
Twists and turns that'll make the room spin
Sights that will leave your eyes a-melting
Act like you've never seen a phantom
You can't light this world of darkness

You heed the ever sounding calling
You need to know your world is falling
'Hero' is what they've all been saying
This world, it isn't worth the saving
Got to earn it, all that courage

Sisters, we need to gather 'round him
Twists and turns that'll make the room spin
Sights that will leave your eyes a-melting
Act like you've never seen a phantom
You can't light this world of darkness

Accept it doesn't even matter
'Hero' is what they've all been saying
Give up on happy ever after
This world, it isn't worth the saving
This world, it isn't worth the saving

Your sight is falling short and narrow
Much like your little bow and arrow
Close to breaking, you can't take this
Population down to zero
This world, it doesn't need a hero
Got to earn it, all that courage

Sisters, we need to gather 'round him
Act like you've never seen a phantom
You can't light this world of darkness

Accept it doesn't even matter
'Hero' is what they've all been saying
Give up on happy ever after
This world, it isn't worth the saving

Accept it doesn't even matter

I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mullato an albino
A mosquito my libido
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

I don't know what to say
Ooh, I don't know what to do
what makes me treat you this way
Oh I get numb in my bones
oh I get numb in my heart
Why don't you leave me alone
before I tear you apart?
I'm no Jesus Christ
I'm the one mistake that you love to hate
I apologize
it's your destiny to get the devil out of me
Oh I don't know what to do
it always ends the same way
Though I've been here before
I know the rules to this game
And though I try not to lose
in the end I will fall
Better to have you in tears
than not to have you at all
I'm no Jesus Christ
I'm the one mistake that you love to hate
I'm no Jesus Christ
I'm the one mistake that you love to hate
I apologize
it's your destiny to get the devil out of me
If you think I'm hard to handle (you give up so easily)
I just need a good example (to be what I used to be)
Get the devil out of me
I'm no Jesus Christ
I'm the one mistake that you love to hate
I apologize
it's your destiny to get the devil out of meSome people will never change
Running your mouth all the same
You and your shadow just blasting my name
I hear the words that you say
I see the games that you play
You and your shadow just blasting my name
Is it hard to take a breath with my name in your mouth
Is it hard to digest that I made it out
You hate me now, you betrayed me now
And you blame me now, cuz you're breaking down
Who would you impress if you take me out?
There's nothing, no one left, it's a daydream now
You're spacing out, no awaking now
No erasing how you played me down
Some people will never change
Running your mouth all the same
You and your shadow just blasting my name
I hear the words that you say
I see the games that you play
You and your shadow just blasting my name
You and your shadow just blasting my name
You and your shadow just blasting my name
I thought by now you would've learned to be discreet
You sing my name, like a bird every time you tweet
I top your feed, but it's not for me
You keep dropping me, like my stock decreased
You should probably be concerned that you dot your T's
Everything's backwards like you stopped on green
Like a clot you bleed, like a thought you see
Like we fought the free, like you're stopping me
Some people will never change
Running your mouth all the same
You and your shadow just blasting my name
I hear the words that you say
I see the games that you play
You and your shadow just blasting my name
You and your shadow just blasting my name
You and your shadow just blasting my name
You'll see your shadow
You'll see your shadow
You should've known, you'd be there all alone
You'll see your shadow
You're on your own (where'd everybody go), wait for tomorrow
You'll see your shadow
You should've known (you'd be there all alone), wait for tomorrow

Some people will never change
Running your mouth all the same
You and your shadow just blasting my name
Blasting my nameScreaming
Running in delight to face another day
Bleeding
We do our part listen what I say
Calling
To become the woods
The way to be the answer
And falling too
Deeper, ever deeper
Fly higher

Flying
It is drying in a certain way
Never trying too hard to push too far
The art of breathing - slowly
Listen now and listen good
Calling
Higher, ever higher
Go deeper

Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution
Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution

Some say:
'I can never rise from the pit'
So they stay just where they fell
What can I tell
Senseless
It is hard to see and to navigate
Rise up
To rid the cancer from the answer
Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution
Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution

Screaming
To face another day
Bleeding
Listen what I say
Calling
To become the woods
And falling too
Lay of the land

Listen and understand
Lay of the land
Listen and understand

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away from the pain you drive in the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
I've lost my lights for I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you （I ran）
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and thats not nearly all
Tainted love woo ao ao
Tainted love
Now I've know I've got to
Run away I've got to get away
You don't really want any more from me who make things right
You need someone hot to touch
You got things most prayed
I'm sorry I don't run away

Once I ran to you （I ran）
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love woo ao ao
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I can't stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm going to pake my things and go
Such a baby tainted love
Such a baby tainted love
Such a baby tainted love
Don't worry tainted love
Once I ran to you （I ran）
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all

I don't care if your world is ending today
Because I wasn't invited to it anyway
You said I tasted famous,so I drew you a heart
But now I'm not an artist I'm a ****ing work of art
I got an F and a C and I got a K too
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like U（you）
You wanted perfect,you got your perfect
Now I'm too perfect for someone like you
I was a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile
But you'll never be as perfect whatever you do
What's my name,what's my name?
Ah-ah,Ah-ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT
What's my name,what's my name?
Ah-ah,Ah-ah
Hold the S because I am an AINT
I am a bonetop,a death's head ,on a mopstick
You infected me to diamonds,I took all your shit
Your "sell-by date"expired,so you had to be sold
I'm a suffer-genius and then a sex symbol
You wanted perfect,you got your perfect
Now I'm too perfect for someone like you
I was a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile
But you'll never be as perfect whatever you do
What's my name,what's my name?

And I lost my leg
Climbing up the top sails
I lost my leg

I'm shipping up to boston wayyyooo
I'm shipping up to boston wayyyyyyyo
I'm shipping up to boston wayyyooo
I'm shipping off to find my wooden leg

I'm shipping off to find my wooden legThe flamme of candles
is lighting up your face
I've been waiting for this moment
You look so pure like in my dream
This feel is like touching heaven
I'm here for you
So take my life
Let my soul fly away
My blood stops running
I'm getting cold
I'm taking my last breath
The flash of scythe will end my life
And take me to the other side
I have no fear, I fell you're near
You are my angel of death
I'm here for you
So take my life
Let my soul fly away
My blood stops running
I'm getting cold
I'm taking my，I'm taking my last breathI've finally found the key 
 To the passage locked till now 
 Behind that gate 
 I guess I'll find my space 
 But maybe I am wrong 
 
 Thousand questions I want to ask 
 But there are no answers 
 I'm getting furious, weak and lost 
 Because I'm on the edge 
 
 I'm on the edge 
 I am mistaken- 
 I'm looking for some clue 
 Which way should I turn ? 
 
 So I got stuck here 
 in this crossroads 
 Considering new step 
 Just like to be or not to be 
 Which is to go or not ! 
 
 I have enough of present life 
 I want to try something else 
 I'm about to cross the line 
 And i will face new life- 
 I'll face new worldRevived, recreated
Every single burn I still feel it
Contaminated but I don’t need the cure
No blood, no redemption
Every single lie I still hear them
Reaching for the sun, I won’t be ignored
I’ve been set ablaze
Now I can finally breathe
Caught in the flames, there's nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
Embrace the change and then you will find
New light will break the shadows inside
The shadows inside!
Blinded, devastated
Everything I was imitated
You used to know me but now you don’t anymore
My world, my reflection
Everything I am separated
All I desired was the spark to restore
I’ve been set ablaze, set ablaze
And I don’t want to change
Caught in the flames, there's nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
Embrace the change and then you will find
New light will break the shadows inside
(The shadows inside)
I burned away my past mistakes
The ashes fade and I remain
Caught in the flames, there's nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
There's nowhere to hide
There's nowhere
Caught in the flames, there's nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows insideTake another look at yourself
Tell me what do you see, what do you see?
Your soul's reflection
Is it what it used to be?
So take another look at yourself
Tell me what do you see?
Answers revolve around our heads
Like figures of our imagination
Measures are taken to purge
Pleasure and take life in as pain

This is bigger than you and me
Cause this is bigger than you and me
Alarms as you wake from this dream
Human fellowship is sacred
Cause this is bigger than you and me
Take another look at yourself
Tell me what do you see, what do you see?
Your soul's reflection
Is it what it used to be?
So take another look at yourself
And tell me what do you see?
As we move along waiting here
Our days repeat and increase
Your default setting
Runs your life secretly
Which direction are you heading?
Escape the pressure
This is bigger than you and me
Alarms as you wake from this dream
Human fellowship is sacred
Cause this is bigger than you and me
Alarms as you wake from this dream
Human fellowship is sacred
Cause this is bigger than you and me
Separate yourself from the machine
Embrace your own identity
Separate yourself from the machine
Embrace your own identity
Escape the pressure
Take another look at yourself
Tell me what do you see, what do you see?
Your soul's reflection
Is it what it used to be?
So take another look at yourself
Tell me what do you see?
Your soul's reflection
Is it what it used to be?
Your soul's reflection
Is it what it used to be?
What do you see?无歌词< Intro >
Djent Djent ~~

Caught in the mundane.
The day to day , it traps us so tightly.
Escape the cubicle cell enslaving time of the resident slave.
Just another clone stamped in the system who can not think for yourself.

It's raining pens and staples on the prisoner questioning
our real purpose.
Bury your sense of worth beneath the desk you call your home.

Consistent overflowing with no way out.
Now you're always entertaining thoughts meandering.
Ambition slowly rolling , steady , down hill . A puppet never disobeying
strings attached from hands to toes.
From hands to ******* toes !

< Guthrie Govan playing solo >

And it's the thrill of life that enables us to flow ,
Locked in the spirit's line , souls entwined , to journey on as one.
I guess it's the fear of all that keeps us on the road ,
Locked in the spirit's line , souls entwined , to journey on as one.

Behold our creation ... A walking dead.
Step back and realize what you are fed.
Escape the mortal mentality.
It's a lesson that can't be ignored for long.
My destination lies within the song.

Blistering reality , imagining a world in limelight.
Never will it be out of my reach.
I've heard the lies a million times , but did it ever steal from my soul ?
Bleeding from the lungs , I see , a life complete above the darkest hole.

< Gorgeous solo by Mr. Govan >

And it's the thrill of life that enables us to flow ,
Locked in the spirit's line , souls entwined , to journey on as one.

A world so masochistic ,
Envious , broken system.
The infant braving infested waters , collecting prominent rage.
Torment in reality , for I leave it.We're constantly falling and failing to find

We're all aspiring to be   So much greater than ghosts
Lately it's been out of reach    My wings have turned to stone
Do not remember me for what I was
Remember me for who I became and forget my flaws
Some live their lives hungry, searching for meaning
Others waste away, underneath the ****ing ceiling
Gasping for air, underneath a sea Of self loathing and misery
I claw my ears to silence all of this ignorance
Trapped in a blindside, of a society
If I could go back in time, I'd change it all    I'd change it all
Oh no,
Nobody knows
We're constantly falling and failing to find
A reason for being alive
Hidden in our souls
Are crystal keys to expansion
And we're dying to feel the light on our skin
In our hands
We've lost ourselves
Have we forgotten just who we are?
Have we forgotten the things that you wanted to say?
Do not remember me for who I was
Remember me for who I became and forget my flaws
This is who we are
The ones you thought you could understand, but you can't and now we
Are moving on
Into the light
A place with consolidation of thought and mind
I'll pray for you, for the sake of progression
But don't mistake this for divine intervention
Everything is just taken for granted
I recognize we're born into false positions
Oh no,
Nobody knows
A reason for being alive无歌词"Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow
One is born to bear within
While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road"

Man weighed down with sorrow
Anguished from the sole being
Destined to live with uneasiness
Always the hard way

"Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow
One is born to bear within
While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road"

"Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow

While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road"

Cold is the world
For the ones excluded
Dark is the path
In the absence of light
Compelled to cherish beauty in longing
Cling on love amidst of the suffering

No chance in disillusion
No, not in this world
Not for a man
Weighed down with sorrow
Only the end of the road作曲 : Friman
 作词 : Friman
And down we go again...
Into the ocean of sorrow
Towards to sea of despair
In the deep groves of the earth
Lifeline running in roaring stream
"Like sand slipping through my fingers
Nothing ever lasts, ever will"
"To impart elegance all living
Experience the grandeur in giving
Felicity found in commitment
Tranquillity in mere being"

And down we go again
Under the relentless waves
Into the arms of calm breakers
Into bayou of forgotten dreams
Like sand slipping through my fingers
Nothing ever lasts, ever will
"To impart elegance all living
Experience the grandeur in giving
From existence into oblivion
Not in cycles but in lines"

Getting nowhere fast
By contending with time
Accept the alteration
Come to terms with your days
Down we go just the same
Into the ocean of sorrow
Towards to sea of despair
This river runs relentlessly
And this river runs deep
This river runs relentlessly
And this river runs deep
Not in cycles but in lines作曲 : Friman
 作词 : Friman
And all the time we've struggled for
Without a reason or a way out
All the grounds we've based our fight on
No one remembers anymore why
And all the blame that has gone into
To run in circles, stand fast still
And all the hatred we've poured into
To fill the trench between us
No more tears from me
These rivers run dry
No more fear in me
This heart's stone inside
And as the shadows give way to light
Grow and thrive
Every day must lose to night
Fade and die
And all the time we spent together
United as one on the same side
And despite the chink in the armour
We fought a good fight, we had our time
And it's a shame we let all precious
Gather rust, brittle and decay
Shame we had to kill all the graceful
To grasp what we really had there
No more tears from me
These rivers run dry
No more fear in me
This heart's stone inside
And as the shadows give way to light
Grow and thrive
Every day must lose to night
Fade and die
No more tears from me
These rivers run dry
No more fear in me
This heart's stone inside
And as the shadows give way to light
Grow and thrive
Every day must lose to night
Fade and die作曲 : As I Lay Dying, Lambeiss
 作词 : As I Lay Dying
We  have  all  heard  what  we  wanted  to  hear
Truth  that  sounds  right  to  our  ears
We  have  all  heard  what  we  wanted  to  hear
Truth  that  sounds  right  to  our  ears
But  what  wisdom  is  there  within  us
To  live  based  on  the  feeling  of  our  hearts?
How  many  times  has  instinct  let  us  down
Never  to  be  thought  through
Never  to  be  questioned
Say  what  you  really  mean
When  your  ambition  calls  you,calls  you
For  what  use  is  there  in  praying
If  you  will  only  hear  what  you  want  to  hear?
We  have  all  heard  what  we  wanted  to  hear
Truth  that  sounds  right  to  our  ears
We  speak  of  fighting  to  resist  this  world
But  what  about  the  battle  within  us?
If  we  have  chosen  to  live  against  the  grain
Then  why  are  we  all  facing  the  same  way?
There  is  no  difference  between  us  and  them
If  we  all  blindly  seek  truth  from  sentiments
We  have  all  heard  what  we  wanted  to  hear
Truth  that  sounds  right  to  our  ears
We  have  all  heard  what  we  wanted  to  hear
Truth  that  sounds  right  to  our  ears
We  have  all  heard  what  we  wanted  to  hear
Truth  that  sounds  right  to  our  earsIt's the end of the world and nobody cares
 Got problems of our own so nobody stares
 At themselves in the mirror anymore
 A good hard look can shake you to the core
 So
 Do you know who you are?
 Part of the solution or the one at fault
 Look in your heart
 Pull the pin, be careful where the fragments go
 Live for yourself, don't care about collateral
 Damage and such don't mean too much
 When your head stuck up in your own asshole
 It's easy not to see (so easy)
 To be blind to the fact that the problems
 That lay before us as we (as we)
 Were created by a lack of our respect
 So
 Do you know who you are?
 Part of the solution or the one at fault
 Look in your heart
 In your heart
 Do you know who you are?
 In your heart
 Yeah, do you know who you are?
 (I do, I do, I know who I am)
 Part of the solution or the one at fault
 (Cause today I'm standing up)
 Look in your heart
 In your heart
 Do you know who you are?
 In your heart作曲：Friman
作词：Friman
I am the last
The one who holds the past
Clinging on something we use to have
I am the last
The one who chose this path
To walk among the world of shadows
Always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls destined to failure
Right from the start
It was always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls set for departure
Before the nightfall

And here I stand
Devoid of faith, bereft of hope
Unable to break the walls around me
And here I stand
Shell of a man from past
Condemned to world of resentment
Always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls destined to failure
Right from the start
It was always one for sorrow
Never one for love

It took two to summon the thunder
One to bring down the rain
Two to torn all asunder
One to suffer the pain
Two to crush dreams and wonders
One to lose everything
All once beautiful and sacred
Nothing but in vain

Always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls destined to failure
Right from the start
Always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls set for departure
Before the nightfallCan you tell from the look in our eyes?
We're going nowhere!
We live our lives like we're ready to die!
We're going nowhere!
Can you tell from the look in our eyes?
We're going nowhere!
We live our lives like we're ready to die!
We're going no where!

I thought I'd buried you,
And covered the tracks.
You'll have to take this with your cold dead hands!
I thought I'd buried you,
Where sin can never die.
I thought I cut you loose,
Severed the feeling,
I stepped through the crack as you clamp to my shirt.
I thought I'd buried you,
Where sin can never die.
****!

Can you tell from the look in our eyes?
We're going nowhere!
We live our lives like we're ready to die!
We're going nowhere!
You can run but you'll never escape,
Over and over again.
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where.
This is Sempiternal!
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal!
Over and over, again and again!
Rise from the dead you say,
Secrets don't sleep till they're took to the grave,
Signal the sirens, rally the troops,
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's the moment of truth.
Can you tell from the look in our eyes?
We're going nowhere!
We live our lives like we're ready to die,
We're going nowhere!
You can run but you'll never escape,
Over and over again!
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where!
Can you tell from the look in our eyes?
We're going nowhere!
We live our lives like we're ready to die,
We're going nowhere!
You can run but you'll never escape,
Over and over again!
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where!
This is Sempiternal!
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal!

Heart  Of  Wilderness
Eternal  Tears  Of  Sorrow
The  night's  too  strong
The  light's  so  weak
This  is  where  it  all  began
It's  all  the  same  once  more
The  times  are  so  dark
They  reach  the  end
The  ancient  omens  are  now  here
The  golden  beast  is  free
It's  free!
I  seek  to  find
The  lost  piece  of  time
Is  the  dream  the  hidden  truth
Or  just  a  shadow  of  the  past?
I  fear  to  lose  all  that  I  have
I'm  a  prisoner  of  my  own  thought
And  I  can't  find  the  way  out
I  look  between  the  stars
I  breathe  between  the  dreams
I'm  just  the  messenger  of  the  truth
The  distant  voice  in  the  dark
I  see  a  falling  star
Which  makes  my  dreams  come  true
Could  it  be  that  now  we  have
All  the  time  in  the  heart  of  the  wilderness?
Music```
Wind  through  the  fire
Light  through  the  dark
Now  it's  the  time  to  build  something  new
And  break  the  wall  of  lies
The  ruins  of  town  I  left  behind
It's  the  time  to  choose  a  brand  new  path
And  face  the  myths  of  life
I  look  between  the  stars
I  breathe  between  the  dreams
I'm  just  the  messenger  of  the  truth
The  distant  voice  in  the  dark
I  see  a  falling  star
Which  makes  my  dreams  come  true
Could  it  be  that  now  we  have
All  the  time  in  the  heart  of  the  wilderness?Artist：chimaira
Songs Title：salvation

Endless nights filled with misery
Sick of familiar patterns
Bruise after cut
Can't wash away my scars
This is a night of salvation （Salvation）
On the night of salvation （Salvation）
This life always pained me
Tired of the same routine
All lies I've told
Can't hide the little things
This is a night of salvation （Salvation）
On the night of salvation （Salvation）
Life has been left behind me
I will not cower away
Cower away

Adrenaline stronger than ever
Feel it all come together
Adrenaline stronger than ever
Feel it all come together
Go

On the night of salvation （Salvation）
On the night of salvation （Salvation）
Life has been left behind me
I will not cower away
Cower away
Salvation
Salvation

Salvation
SalvationWhere is your heart?
Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders, break the walls
Together as one?
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit
(Are we free?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Are we all alone?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you’re gonna accuse me
Of pouring too much salt in the wound
We have just proved that
They can pollute our heads with the news
They will manipulate the masses again
If you’re gonna accuse me of telling you what you already knew
It’s the same song sung with a different truth
And all of us forget it cause our head’s inside the noose
They will manipulate the masses again
Yeah, yeah, yeah we won’t forget it
You better pray for absolution
You can change but you can’t deny
The new wave in a terror nation
(Why do we ignore the warning signs?)
Board it up, the borders are shut
The blood of the innocent is under the rug
White lies in a world corrupt
(Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?)
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Where is your heart?
Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders, break the walls
Together as one?
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit
Are we free?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Are we all alone?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Are we all alone?
Hope widows, shattered windows
Restriction without effect
Dead lines in silhouettes
(Why do we ignore the warning signs?)
Cold calls to derelict homes
Needles at the side of the road
Wires and liars like thorns that won’t let go
(Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?)
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Tell me where is your heart?

I think the silence speaks volumes
Now we march to our own drums
They’re only singing what they want to be sung
Hate’s become the new anthem
How could you? When did our veins run numb？
We treat our species like a ****ing flood
Hate’s becoming our new anthem
The longer I live, I learn that we don’t belong
We’ve taken more than we can give
And you’d do better on your own
The longer I live, I learn that we don’t belong
We’ve taken more than we can give
And you’d do better, better on your own
Are we all alone?
Tear the borders, break the walls
Take us back to when we’re all together as one
Taught to love, born to live and let go
Tear the borders, break the walls
Take us back to when we’re all together as one
Taught to love, born to live and let goI held you close, I think I know
Maybe it’s time that I let you go
Did I not show you
That it meant as much to me as it did to you,
I swore I’d see this through
I could write you,
But would you even read it?
Not read the words but take them as truths no gimmicks,
I could write you,
But now I see things different.
It's not the same between you and I.
It's not the same.
Shatter the pieces of your past weakness,
You need to fail faster to allow you to beat this.
What a ritual, what a script to unfold
The story you were told
Fingernails scratching words on the chalkboard,
Gave me chills, hair stood up on my forearm
The white noise was so hard to pick through,
But I was still there to catch you
Pick you up before your short fuse would get you.
You told me that I would see you again,
Whether in this life or through a future kin
If I could have only one wish, I would ask to be stronger...stronger.
Stronger
When love finds its way
It finds its way back to you
When love finds its way
It finds its way back to you.
Now I see the picture,
I’ve got this special feeling.
Washes over like a perfect memory, but
I know to control my mind,
Before it turns and controls me
When love finds its way
It finds its way back to you.
When love finds its way
It finds its way back to you.作词 : Laiho

（Hang on） got to go
Preview what they oughtta know
Keep your head down and ****ing die

（Wake up） rise and shine
Gotta take another pint

Dig heads and watch out for the night

When the sun comes down and the moon comes up in the sky

The battle of the day and the night

（Kill, kill, kill） go **** another one
Candlelight burns in a wood so high

On a carpet （flying high） take it down to the other side
The way beyond it may lie

When the moon comes up and is rescuing under the night

The reaper is on the other side, let's go

Bodom after midnight

Bodom after midnight yeahThere is a net under the ice
With a thousand knots tied
And unchecked amount of slime
Hanging down
There is a burbot on the net
Into the mesh he has put his head
Now struggling for his life
Entangling more and more
And there is a fisherman on the ice
Drilling a hole with sweat and blood
Trying to draw the net above
The icy surface
But even though how hard he pulls
The net won't budge
Under the ice the net has stuck
With thousand knots into the ground
With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength
But with his latest wrench
The net will tear to shreds
Burbot's revenge
Burbot's revenge
With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength
But with his latest wrench
The net will tear to shreds

But he turned and ran as soon as
I turned my back
It seems as if the way here
Wore worse on me than it did on him
I feel like my words have only given way
To brief intentions but no intent for action
I've waited,
I've asked,
I've hoped
For you to show me
I've thought wrong
Prove to me that
I've thought wrong
And it will fill me further than being right
I wish you'd prove to me that you want to
Live life as much as
I want you to
I swear my hopes are selfless in this
I only want you to feel whole

I can't make your decisions for you
I can't make your decisions for you
I can only be a guide
I can't make your decisions for you

Now show me that

Give the recipes that will heal the sadness
Inside the pill can the saviour is waiting
Swallow the sweet taste of madness
Chemical feelings that everything is going well
Hallucination takes you down into the deepest swamp
The combination, an everlasting, final tramp
Whitout any doubts tomorrows need is more and more
Allowed demon inside the bottle
Hear him calling and he will tear you down
Just take a pull and start the dreaming
Insidious session, Messiah is still bleeding
Chemical feelings that everything is going well
Hallucination takes you down into the deepest swamp
The combination, an everlasting, final tramp
Whitout any doubts tomorrow’s need is more and more
And soon the day will come – black, black
Makes you feel that your are – a scumbag
Standing deep in the swamp – dead end
The only friend that you have – 12 gauge

Good bye  my
Friends, Good ByeHe who has ears to hear, let him hear
For this is a tale of an ancient kind
In the word there lies existence and the word became flesh
And dwelt among us and we saw its glory
Let him hear it who will

Every soul heard
Some ran and hid away
Some listened
Some laughed
Most just stood there
Motionless
Silent
And forgettingThe air is white
Old and colder
Reflect, this life
It fades away

...
All falling, reaching
Where has it gone, seek through despair
Nameless, nothing evades
Time quickens, all falls far
To see this one
All faded away
White becoming black
So old and tired
All is gone...

The rise of a thousand suns in front of me
I have seen the rise of a thousand suns in front of me

spoken:
Heavy eyes on the road of life
Cities pass me by like a flash of who I used to be
The sky is bleeding but I can not see
Ironically you spoke about painting my picture and colouring me in
But the picture you drew didn't include me
It was only you
I guess I'm just so ****ing tired
It's like I'm daydreaming at night and sleepwalking at day
I can't find my pace nor the strength to stay
You always said I should be open, honest and sincere
I guess this is a start
So for the next 40 minutes I will speak from the heart
And the truth is
Maybe I don't deserve to be happy

Light up the darkness

Everywhere I turn I see landscapes in grey
It's a colourless world when the blind lead the way
Our endeavours won't carry us back
The essence of hope still lies on the track
Will we see a new day in this dead and filthy world?

I hear the sound of a thousand screams
Break through the silence of shattered dreams
Don't ever stray from the path they say
Don't you diverge from the masses

I have seen the rise of a thousand suns in front of me
But I never felt the warming touch from the sky above me
I have seen the rise of a thousand suns in front of me
But I never felt the warming touch from the sky above me
Will the dark clouds swallow me? Will the dark clouds swallow me?

I feel the sickness of the world feeding on me
My horizon will fade away
Light of tomorrow come today

And as the sun slowly sets tonight
I feel the dark clouds swallow me
A last string of hope gets buried
Death runs in my black veins
Death runs in my black veins

I have seen the rise of a thousand suns in front of me
But I never felt the warming touch from the sky above me
Will the dark clouds swallow me? Will the dark clouds swallow me?

Let the light of tomorrow come today
We've been hanging on forever on a spark that never came
Let the light of tomorrow come today
We've been hanging on forever on a spark that never came

Let the light of tomorrow come today
We've been hanging on forever on a spark that never came
Let the light of tomorrow come today
We've been hanging on forever on a spark that never cameSo when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
They just hope to hell you've learnt something
Living and breathing
Everybody dies with a debt
No silence, watching death is how we live
Take it or leave it
Don't waste your breath
I clear my mind, deny real life, define "here"
Without borders, possessions or enemies
Everybody dies with a debt
We all die for a life that we fear we will only forget
Or confess to a God that we know we only hear in ourselves
Bottle it up, let your problems distill
Forget your dreams or fulfill them
Leave no trace, waste away
It's time for change
So when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
They just hope to hell you've learnt something
Living and breathing
Four walls in this prison
But I can still see the river
Four walls in this prison
Lies to poison your decisions in life, take note
(Now you tell me why you're living a lie)
Don't ignore it, now you know
I saved my soul
I sold it to the open road
I found hope in the wreckage of progress
Trophies shattered and stained
("Do what you're told")
There's a mold to be broken
A light burning over your name
(And I saved my soul)
But I never said I wasn't the culprit
Never said I wasn't deceived
(I saved my soul)
Just trying to rewrite the wrongs
That were written on me
(I saved my soul)
Everybody dies with a debt
We all die for a life that we fear we will only forget
(I saved my soul)
Or confess to a God that we know we only hear in ourselves
So when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
They just hope to hell you've learnt something

So **** your Bible and your Babel
Make a psalm into my dirty bomb
So dance, mother****er, dance
Racing through red lights
I'm unstable, I'm not a show horse
I can't be bridled, of course
I'm outstanding, I'm unregretted
I got tattooed in reverse
You can't play this game and host all the pieces
Hold your breath and just wait
Someone else will pay for your sins
Not convinced by the cast to the same
My goddamned puppeteers
Woah! Woah!
I'm unstable, I'm not a show horse
I can't be bridled, of course

Your confession means nothing
So **** your attrition
There ain't nothing in my hourglass
Just sands from the Dead Sea
And I'm aiming my weapon
And I'm aiming my weapon
Your confession means nothing
So **** your attrition
There ain't nothing in my hourglass
Just sands from the Dead Sea
And I'm aiming my weapon
**** you about the lady Bible
Make a psalm into my dirty bomb
So dance, mother****er, dance
Racing through red lights

Blood red sky on a desert road
Gotta make my way down to Mexico
For what I did,I know that it was wrong
The fire in my heart it will never die
Everything I love will be left behind
No turning back,forever gone tonight
All my love Anastasia,Anastasia
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight
All I need is a miracle
Lawmen got me running now forevermore
They'll hunt me down until the end of time
Oh my mama,now I've got to go
Never love another how I loved you so
I'm so afraid to leave this all behind
All my love Anastasia,Anastasia
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

Call it liberation or frustration
As it hits like a bomb
Tearing you apart as you're first in line
Entering the zone
Watch how it runs
A nerve wrecking resistance
Watch how it burns
A venomous script's getting formed
You've traveled a long way to get here
And now its waking you up
Waking you up
Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
I'll state my case and never turn
Watch how it runs, watch how it burns
And it's all a deception
Break it and learn, there's no return
For a presence like mine
You've traveled a long way to get here
It's getting all so clear now all the things at least
An elapse of conscious progress will last forevermore
My courageous insanity follows an infinite time
i'll be attaching the world on my shoulders
Without a look inside
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
I'll state my case and never turn
Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolutionHow many times can we say these things
And keep pretending that it never meant anything.
Our minds wonder, but I always knew
When I close my eyes,
All I see
Is
You.
What hurts the most
Is having to know
Words and scars are all I have to show
I put together these letters with pen and paper
Only to write songs of how
We were so close
Wherever I go,
I don't want to go.
Without you
Without you
How can you say
You have nothing to say?
How can you be
At a loss for words?
We fit together like puzzle parts
Nothing in this world
Could tear us apart
How many times can we say these things?And keep pretending that it never meant anything.
Our minds wonder, but I always knew
When I close my eyes,
All I see
Is
You.
Wherever I go,
I don't want to go.
Without you
Without you
A feeling I can't help but chase
It seems somehow I've lost my place
I was gone too long
Now I've been erased
Not even I recognize my face
Not even I recognize my face.
All these places are never the same.
I can't believe I've grown so deranged
You haunt me anyway I run,
I'll never change
Into what you've become
Wherever I go,
I don't want to go.
Without youMissin' You
Wish for your Cold Embrace

Album: Shogunate Macabre

They rose from the night; shouldn't ever been born
Ghouls from the lives that ended so torn
Cursed for the decayed souls they once had
Dishonored warriors no eyes can be laid..

Upon these times of fear and hate
The shadows twisted form on the walls
Upon these times of sin and retributions unclaimed
The spirits will march in the night
Wretched spirits in the night

Despair forms a darkness solid on a torn empire
Spectres roam all around the land
Beings unspoken gathered here from afar

No redemption
Doomed to scavenge!

No freedom
Gods revenge!

Shackles remain on the fallen

No redemption!
No redemption!

Hatred pierces the hearts of men
Bringing down the August Star Of Heaven
Now cursed will be all that once was pure
No forgiveness shall be given..

love surrounding a being
Two fateful heart
evades one from seeing
The number of ways
in a number of ways
To change the pace of the days
into living breathing
living breathing
Silence is golden
Yet the hiding is dying
Silence is golden

Can one find a truth in a star
while peering into the night?
No matter how far
is the flickering light
And one is not what is seen
in all the numbers in every way
How timeless is love
Living breathing
Living breathing
Silence is golden
Yet the hiding is dying
Silence is golden

There is a tree
living in me
Rooted and high
kissing the sky
And in the tree
a night bird sings

The memories echoing here
And the days
How they long to be
Forgotten
You are programmed not to play
But to die
Blind

It is raining again
And there is no need
To wait for the end
Come and see

Saarnaaja niskassaan sianharjaa
Ihmistä vie kuin teuraskarjaa
Se vauhkona epätahdissa huohottaa
Kun huorien herra antaa ja ottaa
Mene pois
Mene pois
Katson silmiin mustan kyyn
Jäisenkylmään katseeseen
Katson siihen niin saan syyn
Syöksyyn kuilun tyhjyyteen
Näen ihmisen

Sietäköön luoja kättensä työt
Kun kourissa päättymättömän yön
Vain varjoja joista ruumiita lankeaa
Ja ryömien jatkaa matkaansa ankeaa
Mene pois
Mene pois
Katson silmiin mustan kyyn
Jäisenkylmään katseeseen
Katson siihen niin saan syyn
Syöksyyn kuilun tyhjyyteen

If somebody's askin' I've gone away
Yeah  somebody's packin' and gone today
The summer was lovely and I enjoyed my stay
Maybe I'll be back one day
Sorry to hurry  but I'll miss my plane
Don't worry about me  I'll be okay
See ya the next time  maybe I'll stop by
Maybe  well  I'll try
Hopefully but I guess
I never cared that much
I never kept in touch
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us
So and so called me yesterday
So and so tells me that's me that so's okay
I don't know  took me far away
Hopefully I'll be back one day
So many places  so many faces
Everything changes and
Everything's the same as
So many places  so many faces
Everything changes
Yeah  typical I guess
I never cared that much
I never kept in touch
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us
Everything sucks
Everything sucks
I never cared that much
I never kept in touch
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of usFrom the deepest of waters
to a burning sky
I've been dragged through golden aisles of everyday malice
Sometimes a whisper are't enough
Sometimes it's all you need
Past times will make your reasons up
A world you've been spared to believe
As it shows I could've been dreaming
through all of this
I know it never goes
The way you were raised to kneel and perceive
The words, the shadows, the way
You all just left me to be
Bring me fortune as I die
When they call for me
saying, "Son, you're heartless."
I won't believe it
The ride majestic
How can it cease when I transcend
All these images lost in the end
A later storm that will take it all
And wash us all away
Never think it'll be over
It moves in circles
Changing shapes and throwing you back to where it all began
I've earned my right
I've earned my shelter
Now let me move on
Sometimes the strive is all in vain
Sometimes it gets you there
The skies, the darkness, the sea
You all just showed me the way
Bring the fortune as I die
Carry my message
The sky declined
Marry the fire(x2)
If it still hurt bring it forth to those deprived
(When they call for me )
When they call for me
saying, "Son, you're heartless."
I won't believe it
The ride majestic
How can it cease when I transcend
All these images lost in the end
A later storm that will take it all
And wash us all away
When they call for me
saying, "Son, you're heartless."
I won't believe it
The ride majestic作词 : Korn, Matrix
Keep holding on
When my brain's tickin' like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along , mockingbird
You don't affect me
That's right
the labyrinth's of my heart
destory
Be deliver it
Wait , I'm coming undone
Unlaced , I'm coming undone
Too late , I'm coming undone
What looks so strong , so delicate
Wait , I'm starting to suffocate
And soon I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong , so delicate
Choke , choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Getting me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I've tasted sorrow on my tongue
And this sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me
That's right
Trigger between my eyes
Please strike
Make it quick now
Wait , I'm coming undone
Unlaced , I'm coming undone
Too late , I'm coming undone
What looks so strong , so delicate
And soon I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong , so delicate
I'm trying to hold it together
Head is like a elevator
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better
Wait , I'm coming undone
Unlaced , I'm coming undone
Too late , I'm coming undone

So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too
We're about to go down
And you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Gilde by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick mamma
Come on baby tell me what's the word
Word up everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up it's the code word
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard
Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and you act real cool
But you got to realise that you're acting like fools
If there's music we can use it
Be free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me mamma
Come on baby tell me what's the word

Numb and broken
Here I stand alone
Wondering what were
The last words I said to you
Hoping, praying
that I'll find a way To turn back time
Can I turn back time?

What would I give to behold.
The smile the face of love
You never left me
The rising sun
Will always
speak your name!

Where the dark waters of Tuonela flows
Where great legends and heroes lived
Where coniferous woods of Tapiola spread
Inpassable forests ofSee them gathered on the plains now
See an army strong and vast
As long as one of us remains here
None of them will ever pass

Here they come so raise the shields high
Like wolves they show their teeth
None of us will ever yield now
To the scavengers beneath

We're outnumbered ten to one here
Still, I love the odds
We will sacrifice them one by one
Send them off to the gods

Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die

Here they come ten thousand strong
Charging up the hill
This day will be both hard and long
They move in for the kill

Hold the line don't let it break
Use your sword and spear
A glory death, for all awaits
All who knows no fear

Hordes of men they hit the shields
Like waves they break away
We face our woven destiny
And we don't fear the grave

Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall diei never thought i'd be
as close to the edge as i am today
if there's no one to hold me back
i might be better off taking a step forward
but there's one thing i can't forget
the promise i made to never regret
to never look back
and to always be brave
but what if i'm the one who needs to be saved
what if there's no savior
what if there's no way to come back home
what if we wait forever
to find a way - we'll find a way
over and over
again and again
will we be released
will it ever end
demanding our hero
we're crying for help
if time won't save us
can we save ourselves
searching for answers, a restless mind
a place that knows
neither dark nor light
a truth i denied
something left undone
the fear i swore i would overcome
we'll find a way
what if there's no savior
what if there's no way to come back home
what if we wait forever
to find a way - we'll find a way
over and over
again and again
awaiting our savior without avail
i won't cry for help
rather trade my life
for the trust in myself
if there's no one who can
enlighten my pathway from now til the end
if there's no one to right me
to hold and to guide me
i'll raise my head
for i'm surviving
if there's no one who can
enlighten my pathway from now til the end
if there's no one to right me
to hold and to guide me
i'll raise my head
for i'm survivingWell I'm an outlaw
I make my living on the run
My life is lonely
But I was born to need no one
Always on my own
Oh…
My gun is loaded
I'm a six-shot heart attack
I pull the trigger
So you better watch your back
Looking in out for no.1 so you had better take this piece of advice
Make your move
Stick 'em up or kiss your ass goodbye
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky
Well it's a show down
This is what I do for fun
I got a reputation
Yeah I'm the fastest gun
I'm livin' on the highway
Movin' on from town to town
You better do it my way
Or I will shoot you down
Looking in out for no.1 so you had better take this piece of advice
Make your move
Stick 'em up or kiss your ass goodbye
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky
Take you best shot
Oh go for your guns baby
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky
Oh reach for the sky作曲 : Konstantinos Karamitroudis

Rage and fire in me
Turns a boy (in)to a soldier
There’s no wrong or right in the fight
For we do as we are told

Years went by and and I became
A king to lead this land to fame
Deep inside I feel the power
When it’s over, it's over

And the fear inside us
Will never divide us all
For united we'll never fall

We will never know the future
We will only know the past
For an instant there'll be sorrow in their eyes

There'll be no one to surrender
And our numbers (are) fading fast
Victory will not rewind the hands of time

In the southern sea
Vicious strikes on the water
No bridge left to cross
We'll destroy everything you leave behind

All in my head and out of my mind
I'm keeping the faith with forces allied
If theres a chance I’ll make someone pay the price
But the war’s not over

And the fear inside us
Will never divide us all
For united well never fall

We will never know the future
We will only know the past
For an instant there'll be sorrow in their eyes

There'll be no one to surrender
And our numbers (are) fading fast
Victory will not rewind the hands of time

I know I can't define this life
I know you can't see through these answers
I'm seeking for are way too deep to be found
My life's reflected through the wet film of my eyes (my eyes)
I've been betraying the kid that I was.
Do you think this life really deserves an anthem?
I've been changing
It reminds me when I was younger and useless.
My heart beats, covered in bruises.
I saw this room slowly turn to a coffin.
As locked in, but I'm not dead yet.
I did my best to show you that I've been changing,
And what I've been through to see clearly through myself.
Through myself.
I was such a mess before this
I don't miss it, no, I don't miss it.
My heart has braced itself.
I'll set this world in check,
I finally found myself.
I've got my dreams and all my memories in my head.
I don't wanna be the one who can live without this.
All that I can see is the distance since these days.
I wouldn't recognize myself without the mess of what I've done with my life
I will never let you define my way of life.
I thought we've been watching the same sun
But we're way too far to finally feel warmed.
This is my time to speak
This is the time to forgive.
I've been betraying the kid that I was.
Do you think this life really deserves an anthem?
I didn't think the show would last so long
Though it should last forever now.
I was seeking for this,
Having a chance to speak to try to feel better.
I see your face when your eyes are staring back at me.
I can fake it, it's not as hard as it seems with the detachment the drug brings
I've got these dreams to stand for,
Got my voice to speak
Despite the lies around me now
But this bitter taste that they're leaving won't let me feel anything. (delay feel anything)
It reminds me when I was younger and useless.
My heart beats, covered in bruises.
I saw this room slowly turn to a coffin.
As locked in, but I'm not dead yet.
I did my best to show you that I've been changing.
And what I've been through
To see clearly through myself.
Through myself.
I was such a mess before this
I don't miss it, no, I don't miss it.
My heart has braced itself.
I'll set this world in check,
I finally found myself.
I've got my dreams and all my memories in my head.
I don't wanna be the one who can live without this.
All that I can see is the distance since these days.
I wouldn't recognize myself without the mess of what I've done with my life作曲 : Ranta

We were together as one
All that we had can't be undone
Our love fading, now it's gone
Our time fading, so it's done

The blood that binds us
(It's the blood that binds us)


Alone we die, my Frozen Angel
Alone we fade away from this world
Alone you die, my frozen Angel
Alone you fade away, from - this - world!

We were together as one,
All that we had can't be undone
Our love fading, the feeling is gone
One time ending, now it's done

Alone we die, my frozen angel
Alone we fade away from this world
Alone you die, my frozen Angel
Alone you fade away from this world

Alone we die my frozen angel
Alone we fade away, from this world
Alone you die, my frozen angel
Alone you fade away from this world

Alone we die my frozen angel
Alone we fade away, from this world
Alone you die, my frozen angel
Nothing I do, nothing I say...
Fade away, My Angel!I open my eyes
I see the sun shining through the night
The light that blinds Reflex the fear that I have no time
I watch the leaves
I see the glance shining icy bright
The day has come
I step outside facing darker side
Warmth keeps fading
Frost is cutting
Air I'm breathing
Death cold feeling
Now I see the hordes are coming
I'm still living!
Face of the Winterking
White frost on the fields
Creeps into the souls
Force of the Winterreal
Across the clear blue sky
The reign of snow will rise
Battle begins
Our Blades are sharp and against the foe
We march out
Mellow men fight against time
The field is lost
Save your souls from the Winterking
Leave this place
Cause your damned and you fight in vain
Warmth keeps fading
Frost is cutting
Air I'm breathing
Death cold feeling
Now I see the hordes are coming
I'm still living!
Face of the Winterking
White frost on the fields
Creeps into the souls
Force of the Winterreal
Across the clear blue sky
The reign of snow will rise
Time is running out
I am old and tired
Afraid of dying reckless
Golden light admired
The King's sword is grazing me
Remorsefulness desired
He covers the skies
Looks out the sun brings us endless nights
The ruler of ice
Collects the souls of the fallen knights
The fields is lost
Save tour souls from the Winterking
Leave this place
Cause your damned and you fight in vain
Warmth keeps fading
Frost is cutting
Air I'm breathing
Death cold feeling
Now I see the hordes are coming
I'm still living!
Face of the Winterking
White frost on the fields
Creeps into the souls
Force of the Winterreal
Across the clear blue sky
The reign of snow will riseAll these moments of pain
Must add up to something,
Our bodies have been trained to keep it all in,
But our hearts, still hold on
Some say to release it, forget about your past,
Instead we count the cost, it's part of us
That doesn't mean that we cannot move on,
It's just a memory of what we were once were
No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (part of us)
We can overcome
Why rid of fuel that can make us stronger
When properly put behind us (put behind us)
And in the same way that
Everything good in life can be taken away
So can all this pain
No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (part of us)
No matter what we've faced in this life
We can overcome
Trying to forget is a burden we can never bear,
When facing trials openly,
There's nothing left to hide,
New paths of strength come alive
There's nothing left to hide,
New paths of strength come alive
we can overcome
we can overcome
No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (part of us)
No matter what we've faced in this life
We can overcome
We can overcome
we can overcome
we can overcome作词 : Brändström, Jivarp, Stanne
There  is  this  face  in  the  still  water
I  can't  remember  ever  wearing
Like  fingerprints  on  your  heart
Reading  out  the  last  lines  of  code
To  the  untrained  eye  a  secret
I  bled  away  the  last  of  you
Sought  trust  in  shapes  of  combined  results
That  trickles  from  a  less  than  solid  case
Fought  off  attacks  of  resurfaced  lust
Burn  the  gracing  grounds
What  will  give  in  first
The  body  or  the  lash
Monochromatic  stains
Who  will  cave  in  first
The  leader  or  the  fake
Monochromatic  stains
This  pile  of  ashes  of  a  soul
Informant  pokes  abound
These  sickly  little  fingers
Get  away  from  me
Tread  not  the  path  of  least  restraint
Each  piece  of  evidence  a  lie,a  lie
The  body,the  face  all  items  in  place
I  don't  remember  a  thing
What  will  give  in  first
The  body  or  the  lash
Monochromatic  stains
Who  will  cave  in  first
The  leader  or  the  fake
A  sacrifice  made  to  the  loss  of  mind
Folly  a  man's  demise
Track  now  the  stains  that  allow  my  fall
Sickening,the  sight  of  it  all
Never  shall  I  claim  my  innocence
I  just  was  not  there
What  will  give  in  first
The  body  or  the  lash
Monochromatic  stains

Where I spend every waking moment wishing I was dead.
For a few minutes get me away from here,
For a few minutes wipe away my tears.
For I am lost right now as the ocean deep;
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink.
Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep;
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink.
It's like there's cancer in my blood,
It's like there's water in my lungs,
And I can't take another step,
Please tell me I am not undone.
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath,
Please tell me I am not undone.
I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head;
Where I spend every waking moment wishing this would end.
I can't take another step, I cannot live inside my mind,
I can't face another day, I am so ****ing tired.
For I am lost right now as the ocean deep,
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink.
Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep,
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink.
It's like there's cancer in my blood,
It's like there's water in my lungs
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone.
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within.
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone.
I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head;
Where I spend every waking moment, wishing I was dead.
I'll take another step for you
I'll shed my tears until I drown, or until I am underground.
I'll take another breath for you...
Will you still be there when I'm home, out from the great unknown?
It's like there's cancer in my blood,
It's like there's water in my lungs,
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone.
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within.
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone.
It's like there's cancer in my blood,
It's like there's water in my lungs

I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone.I cannot close my eyes
I'm watching sleeping beauty
The world without the fear,
the world without the pain

Tonight there are no tears, no cry
Tonight there are no painted smiles
Tonight...

There is a ghost on the sun
When night has fallen on the ground
Angels are dancing on the sky
I'm watching sleeping beauty

Tonight your voice is calling again
Everything is so perfect, you are here tonight
I buried you deep in my heart
and now our fate becomes one

There is a ghost on the sun
When night has fallen on the ground
Angels are dancing on the sky
I'm watching sleeping beauty

There is a ghost on the sun
When night has fallen on the ground
Angels are dancing on the sky
I'm watching sleeping beautyUnder the starlight skies
I watch her snow white face
On sleeping leaves my angel's tears
Shine light that's quiet and cold
In beautiful darkness
Birds of death sing in the end
All these memories will be lost
All these dreams forever gone
Shadows dance in the quiet mist
What lies beyond the darkness...
In beautiful darkness
Birds of death sing in the end
Beneath the starry skies
Forever sleeps the angel soul
You drowned with Sun
You broke my heart
In beautiful darkness
Birds of death sing in the end
Beneath the starry skies
Forever sleeps the angel soul作曲 : Draconian
 作词 : Draconian
I've made a good living by dying

Endless wait, grey solace ruling my mind
Constrained by time and drained by the cold,

Still I found myself shivering under the rising sun

You are the star, you are the moon

You are the soil where shadows bloom
Casting a light which brings me peace

Where the caverns of death will freeze

The flower never grew
But I love you just the same

Even though like a bird you flew
I will love you just the same

I am the blood A fire in your soul...
And I will grow in landscapes so cold
Oh, how I feel you in every single detail,
As you lurk inside my troubled dreams
There is no hope as long we walk this Earth,

But you should know my uni screams,
It screams for you

I cry for you!

The flower never grew
But I love you just the same

Even though like a bird you flew
I will love you just the same"Black Tears (Edge of Sanity cover)"
Album: Iconoclast

When I'm in this state of mind,
I'm wishing I was blind,
Sometimes life is more than pain to me

I feel the power of my grief,
Death would be such a relief,
All the secrets that I hide would die with me

Depression is my only friend,
Will this torture never end?
Let me carry on to dreamer's sky

I keep crying in my dreams,
Can you hear my endless screams?
When I fade away, I fade away...

This fluid on my cheek,
It drains me, I get weak
My heart is cold and bleak
Black blood, black tears.

Black tears, black tears.

Life is like a masquerade,
In dept to myself, but I can't pay,
Soon I'll call it all a day, away

I never felt what you call guilt,
I still believe "Do what thou wilt",
My sorrow will destroy the world I've built

This fluid on my cheek,
It drains me, I get weak
My heart is cold and bleak
Black blood, black tears.

Black tears, black tears.låt oss ta allt från varandra
låt oss ta allt från oss själva
låt polerna verka och avge kall smuts
bestjäl mig den gudomliga gnistan
sparka det lyckliga flinet ur mitt vidriga anlete
och låt stålet begravas i det böljande kött
som på denna jord vandra i uselt intet
med en steril blick på livet och allt däruti
väntar vi andaktigt på den heliga bödeln
han som obönhörligen annalkas att utföra sitt signade värv

"I'll be okay. I hate myself, it's awful. It's so awful!"
min dom föll tidigt och utan pardon
och domen skall även falla på dig som är forutan tro
i detta finner mitt skuggjag tröst och sadistisk glädje
att vi alla skall smekas utav flammornas ömma kärlek
i evighet, amen
Ugh!
Låt honom ta allt ifrån dig！I foresee at my end to be banished

By your god for my life and branding

Never around, in the greatness of sorrow

Screw your god and his UN writ moral

Stifle god and the idols of hatred

Out of my heart, I have always been free

One with no need all alone and satanic

Wretched and Vile, **** your god, de face him

Who could believe in a lord that's demanding

Hard to believe when we die we vanish

In his deny and for all his creation

**** your god and his righteous hatred

You and your son, you are nothing but absence

Something not there that controls this planet

Only deceit do I see in your hallow

If you believe you will dwell in failure

**** your god, holy mother for the whore she is

**** your god, bible thumper preaching threats from hymn

**** your god, his revival and the holy ghost

**** your god, only tell us what we need to know

**** your god, pointing fingers and then do as me

**** your god, you are nothing and you'll never be

**** your god, it is Satan who in trusts my soul

**** your god, where the Christians are I will not go

**** your god

**** his commandments and prophet's left stranded to die

Not in my heart or my soul as I go through this life

Good book of bullshit lay dirty with vengeance and lies

Go **** your Jesus and get the **** out my sight

Unity over flowing with anger

It is our time to remove the savior

Christians are weak and the bible is beaten

Homage to god, in this world not needed

**** your god an his anals of plaguer

Falling apart and exposing the light

I will not live by the words of their Jesus

He did not die to protect or save me

There is just blood in his book of deceiving

Riddles and crap to his divine healing

Fail is your faith and you blame it on Satan

Christians can't see that their preys are wasted

Not a slave to religion unrendered

Falsified god and his Christ redempters

Never to be in the presence of grandeur

I am for me and forever after

**** your god, holy mother for the whore she is

**** your god, bible thumper preaching threats from hymn

**** your god, his revival and the holy ghost

**** your god, only tell us what we need to know

**** your god, pointing fingers and then do as me

**** your god, you are nothing and you'll never be

**** your god, it is Satan who in trusts my soul

**** your god, where the Christians are I will not go

**** your god, **** youWhen all the bodies will burn.
I'm grieving for the minds of the missed,
But if you won't miss forever,
Then all the bodies will burn into the hands of a broken heart.
We are the black youth, try and tear us apart.
I don't belong in this, this is the furthest I can get to try and deal with it.
And after all the pain they inflict, we have no blood but we have a purpose.
Can you feel it take, take, take?
All you ****ing do is take, take, take.
And the fools at the front slide their guns through the gates.
You call this a messiah but were not broken,
You've got problems but you won't solve them.
Broken, like the back of the bastard youth.
So **** the law 'cause we wrote the order.
We might be the gutter of society but to ourselves we have a promise to keep.
Call us worthless, call us cheap but we know we can and we will if we're told no again,
We should, we won't 'cause we're in it for them.
**** the law, we wrote the order.
**** the bridge 'cause we built the borders.
I'd rather take my life than believe.
I'd rather rot with the answers.
And you take
You always keep taking, always keep taking from me.
You call this a messiah, well I call it a murder.
Can you feel it?
This is a personal promise, the burden upon us.作曲 : Sevänen
 作词 : Sevänen
Wreathed in silence, laid down in shades
Swathed in regrets, deluded astray
Forgotten in half-light, drawn in despair
Soothed in slumber so dreadful and fair
Rending and searing and twisting my dreams
Alone in the gloom with the nightmares unseen
The night has a thousand eyes,
And the day but one;
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun
The mind has a thousand eyes,
And the heart but one:
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done
Worthless the pledges, all vows but lies
Fateful her kisses, where a serpent hides
First beckoned to step from the twilight to glare
Then left in the dark for the demons to share
The night has a thousand eyes,
And the day but one;
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun
The night has a thousand eyes,
And the day but one;
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun
The mind has a thousand eyes,
And the heart but one:
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done
Only the stars see, only the moon hears…
And quietly the water-lilies sigh
Like the last breath of a weary soul
And the weed sway in the dreary waters
Like a girl’s dark hair they wave about
And the black stones under my bare feet
Cold and smooth like her milk-white palm
And the silence which falls upon this shore
Resounds now louder than oncoming storm
For all is gone
(Only the stars see, only the moon hears…)You live in house for dying people
Next door stands old theatre
Which is closed
For too much long
As a time as you are alone
Beating the time by touching memories
Reading forgotten script
Wrinkled face
Ripped curtain
No mark seen in the dirty crypt
I am the man
Who's never spoken word
Who's never breathe fresh air
I'm dust on old red chair
I am the man
Who's never seen the play
Who's never to tried get there
I'm just running away
No more play, you lost a way
To change the fate which's ****ing grave
You can hope but in a blame, only cry remains

Life has gone out of this place
Ghosts of past cover me
I am too old
My life is done
What can I do to stay alive
Looking through the window every hour
Once a man now zombie
Woken all night
She is your bride
Almost you are resting in grave
No more play, you lost a way
To change the fate which's ****ing grave
You can hope but in a blame, only cry remains

No melody there in orchestra
Dark corners occupied by spiders
Just for once say goodbye
To the old man and his pain
For the last time switch on the lights
For the last time give me a chance
Stuck up cruel fate for the last time
Stuck up cruel fate give me a chance

I do nothing to feel better
Never did a right step
Never feel love
Never feel hate
Expecting nothing waiting for death
****
Never hit you a storm
You lose your life
I lose my soul
Fate you're a jocker and I am a worm
Worm without a privilege of existence
Better to smash you when
You come out from womb
The ****ed tomb
Or kill me when I was in there
From the cradle to grave everything is blackened
Mountains of fear and shame
Lost life you have
Lost life I take
Six feet under is where I'll stay作曲 : Thierry Bertone

Moving short tails, rubbing soft furs
Winter's coming, sons are growing, chaos comes to town
Damn instinct, trigger-actions, avoiding the crowd
Merciless algorithm - drops the exp(onential) curve
Repetition of a race - drops the exp(onential) curve
We are just Lemmings and we won't come back
We are just Lemmings hiding our tracks
We are just Lemmings and we're drowning
We are just Lemmings into mourning
Follow the map we never saw
Dying in the point we tried to go
Look at the steps of those above
We are just Lemmings seeking for love

Licking tiny feet, running alongside the cliff
An eye to your fellow, your fellow to the cause
Feet and brains, furs and eyes, towards the same goal
Same flow, many Lemmings, the meaning of an ideal
Merciless algorithm - drops the exp(onential) curve
Repetition of a race - drops the exp(onential) curve
We are just Lemmings and we won't come back
We are just Lemmings hiding our tracks
We are just Lemmings and we're drowning
We are just Lemmings into mourning
Follow the map we never saw
Dying in the point we tried to go
Look at the steps of those above
We are just Lemmings seeking for love

We are just Lemmings and we won't come back
We are just Lemmings hiding our tracks
We are just Lemmings and we're drowning
We are just Lemmings into mourning
Follow the map we never saw
Dying in the point we tried to go
Look at the steps of those above
We are just Lemmings seeking for love
We are just Lemmings and we won't come back
We are just Lemmings hiding our tracks
We are just Lemmings and we're drowning
We are just Lemmings into mourning
Follow the map we never saw
Dying in the point we tried to go
Look at the steps of those above
We are just Lemming seeking for love
(Miss Lyrics)无歌词无歌词No longer I know how to act.
This mother******' situation gonna make me mad!
"It's up to you: You just should leave!"
I tried to but I couldn't go!
"Don't stay with her! Now let it end!"
My mind says 'yes', my heart says 'no'.
Cognitive Note of Discord,
My mind says 'yes', my heart says 'no'.
I'm so - I'm so confused, what shall I do?
Cognitive Note of Discord,
What have you done? You've simply come,
you took - you took me up and hit me down!
I'm getting crazy 'cause of you.
I don't see light and I really don't know what to do - So: ****** you!
"Come on! So please make up your mind!"
No wise ideas I can find.
"Then try to listen to your heart!"
Sometimes I want, sometimes I don't.
She's sucked me in, and spat me out.
She has taken my last proud.
What's going on? I cannot see.
Cognitive Dissonance in me!
Cognitive Note of Discord,
My mind says 'yes', my heart says 'no'.
I'm so - I'm so confused, what shall I do?
Cognitive Note of Discord,
My mind says 'yes', my heart says 'no'.
I'm so - I'm so confused, what shall I do?
Cognitive Note of Discord,
What have you done? You've simply come,
you took - you took me up and hit me down!
Cognitive Note of Discord,
My mind says 'yes', my heart says 'no'.
I'm so - I'm so confused, what shall I do?
Cognitive Note of Discord,
What have you done? You've simply come,
you took - you took me up and hit me down!无歌词I tried to wait till' now
When everything seemed so black
Black is my religion
Black is my religious star
Wait, try to be my excellent
My absolute sacrifice
Don't fear if you're wrong
I can be lost and found
No! I can not wait
To kill your ****ing lie
It seems you never get out
Nothing more shall I want
Pay back role
I'm trying out to be saved
I'm calling that fate
It speaks to me now
Well try to be my God
No! I can not stop this flame from burning
No way I can make it, till' the end!
No control
I can kill you
Till' the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of flies
Till' the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of flies

I can be really thankful
I can be forever damned
No! I can't be all alone
I can't be all alone
A total awaking
A total awaking
It's up to me
It's up to me
Till' the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of flies
Till' the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of flies

Till' the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of flies
Till' the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of fliesIn the starlight, hallucinating
Knee-deep in a lake of fire
Radiated, mutated
Fade away to the darkness

Shattered dreams, twisted nightmares
All I hear is everlasting silence
A flash of bright light in the night
My mind got clearer, focusing thoughts

In the coming days I can see the new dawn of man
No more dead and gone, no more lost in the desert sand
In the distant skies, roaring storm cracks open the sky
We're rising from the shadows in the wasteland

I see patterns in darkened forms
All the colors are out of space
Visions unlike I've never seen or known
All fade away as I feel the shiverShe was the key to my darkest heart
Holding hands with the seekers of the path
A forced face from the lingering hate
A fake grace for the closing eyes in the crowd
Reverse your rightness, let go of control
Beware of the denying, it's in your hall
You have the same ability to do as them
Don't count your mistakes, get in the line and do what it takes
She was the weakest in the world of liars
Maybe the only one left that was telling the whole truth
Waiting for that moment again in this misplaced childhood
Ready to faint she will accept it, clutching at the tears in her mind
The flock didn't pay in pain like the others
Body to the ground, gravel in those tiny eyes
For each day she struggles the degradation
Forever bound to walk the fields of disgrace
She was the key to my darkest heart
Holding hands with the seekers of the path
A forced face from the lingering hate
A fake grace for the closing eyes in the crowd
She was the weakest in the world of liars
Maybe the only one left that was telling the whole truth
Waiting for that moment again in this misplaced childhood
Ready to faint she will accept it, clutching at the tears in her mind
In The Failing Hour作曲 : Lamminaho
A real of the dark hemisphere
They signed us here for life
Enchained us, tore away our pride
No will to resist, no will to exist
Experimenting with these newly born
A little game with the insane
Rolling back the time for centuries
Make us live and die like our fathers

Harvest the damned, reap the bleak
Bring here for us to bear
Enchanted simplicity
For a mind, so blind, so open to find
This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger
This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger

Inner peace, enchains me
Entities fall off from the timeline
Burning will, storms there still, suffocated thrill
Subconscious ravishment

This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger
This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger
This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger
This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger...Out from the darkened night,
Into the burning hot cleansing steam...
My weak endeavour to stay clean;
From all the filth that I've gladly taken in.
Failed escape from reality;
My soul lies unwanted with a stain of sin...
I feel myself impure;
I need the cleansing;
Craving for more of your love...
I feel myself unclean;
I need the cleansing;
Oh, wash me clean from these stains in me...
...Out from the hot burning steam,
Into the frozen cold granular snow...
The filth I've seen on my way;
Hasn't stain me like the evil from within.
Evil deeds and words I say;
I've soiled my soul with a stain of sin...
I feel myself impure;
I need the cleansing;
Craving for more of your love...
I feel myself unclean;
I need your blessing;
Only you can clean these stains in me...Dedicated to Lady Godiva †1085

Some safe me from the burning
Ride against these dire times
Versus all apathy
And disregard
Yielding new hope
To all the fallen ones
To all the silenced
To those unheard

A sign of hope in peaceless times
A shining light
Amongst the darkest knights
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them
Godiva, promise me
Convey our hate and screams

Will you bury them
Godiva will you bury them
No truth will ever reach them
No word will ever touch him
A life beyond
Beyond all sympathy

A sign of hope in peaceless times
A shining light
Amongst the darkest knights
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them
Godiva, promise me
Convey our hate and screams

One day the tide is turning
And nothing will be left for them
Of all their vanity
Of all this selfishness
Godiva
will you bury them
Lady Godiva
when will you ride again

No truth will ever reach them
No word will ever thouch him
A life beyond
Beyond all sympathy

A sign of hope in peaceless times
A shining light
Amongst the darkest knights
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them
Godiva, promise me
Convey our hate and screams

珈略山梦境联盟Well, I'm a hot blooded girl
I take what I want, yeah
Come tomorrow I'll be gone

Wear your heart on my sleeve, yeah

Where the sun don‘t ever shine.
I would shiver the whole night through.
My girl,my girl,where will U go?
I’m going where the cold wind blows.
In the pines！in the pines！
Where the sun don’t ever shine.
I would shiver the whole night through.
Her husband,was hardworking man.
Just about a mile from here.
His head was found in a driving wheel.
But his body never was found.
My girl,my girl,don’t lie to me.
Tell me where did U sleep last night.
In the pines！in the pines！
Where the sun don’t ever shine.
I would shiver the whole night through.

I’m going where the cold wind blows.
In the pines！in the pines！
I would shiver the whole night through.Let the ocean take me...
You've gotta know kid that it ain't easy.
To take on all of your grieving, yeah you gotta believe me.
Well don't lean on me 'cause I am falling, please don't fall with me.
I really need you here, yeah I need you so don't leave.
And don't count on me 'cause I am drowning, please don't drown with me.
Just hold me in your heart, let the ocean take me.
let the ocean take me
And you think I don't read every message that you send?
You think I turn a blind eye, you think I'm just like them?
It breaks my heart, all these stories, brings me to tears all this grief;
and I feel so ****ing helpless when I can't be your relief.
Well don't lean on me 'cause I am falling, please don't fall with me.
I really need you here, yeah I need you so don't leave.
And don't count on me 'cause I am drowning, please don't drown with me.
Just hold me in your heart, let the ocean take me.
There is hope in my eyes, there is hope in these words.
And there are far too many reasons for you to stay here on this earth.
Stay with me.
Well don't lean on me 'cause I am falling, please don't fall with me.
I really need you here, yeah I need you so don't leave.
And don't count on me 'cause I am drowning,
please don't drown with me.
Just hold me in your heart, let the ocean take me.
Let the ocean take me.
let the ocean take meIt all begins from this point and it's the point for all this to end
Every story has got an ending, but his is the one
That keeps going without it
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me!
I pull the trigger to escape
I have followed the path and walked through the door
I have hated you so much, but now I know
It would be pointless forevermore
Countless nights spent on just pacing under the streetlights
This is the part of the play where the hero is sentenced to death
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me!
I pull the trigger to escape
Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edgeIt's time for your medication, Mr. Brown
MUAHAHAHAHA
White coats to bind me, out of control
I live alone inside my mind
World of confusion, air filled with noise
Who says that my life's such a crime?
Trapped, in this nightmare
I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me
An empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze
'Cause I don't care
Fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
I can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame
It's a Madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a Madhouse
Oh, am I insane?
My fears behind me, what can I do
My dreams haunt my sleep at night
Oh no, won't learn their lesson, white fills my eyes
And only then they see the light
Trapped, in this nightmare
I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me
An empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze
'Cause I don't care
Fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
I can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame
It's a Madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a Madhouse
Oh, am I insane?
Trapped, in this nightmare
I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me
An empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze
'Cause I don't care
Fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
I can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame
It's a Madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a Madhouse
Oh, am I insane?Walking these dirty streetsWith hate in my mind
Feeling the scorn of the world
I won't follow your rules
Blame and lies, Contradictions arise
Blame and lies, Contradictions arise
Nonconformity in my inner self
I won't change my way
It has to be this way
I live my life for myself
Forget your filthy ways
Blame and lies, Contradictions arise
Blame and lies, Contradictions arise
Nobody will change my way
Life betrays, but I keep going.
There's no light, but there's hope
Crushing oppression, I win
Betraying and playing dirty, you think you'll win
But someday you'll fall, and I'll be waiting
Laughs of an insane man, you'll hear
Personality is my weapon against your envy
Walking these dirty streets
With hate in my mind
Feeling the scorn of the world
I won't follow your rules
Nonconformity in my inner self
Only I guide my inner selfTo rid the earth of the filth
To rid the earth of the lies
To will the rise above
Tearing my insides out
I feel my soul go cold
Only the dead are smiling
To rid your heart of all lies
Their poison tongues, poison hearts
Burning cold&
Now let the final darkness fall
"&The dream of the new disease
On wings of euphoria&
Sucking terror from the needle scars&"
22 years of pain
And I can feel it closing in
The will to rise above
Tearing my insides outWe are blind to the worlds within us
Waiting to be born'

I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
Born of the demon sky
Twisting reality
Sweet nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
I cast aside my chains

Fall from reality
Suicidal disease
The face of all your fears
Now covered with sores
Humanity exiled
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth

I hear the rain again,
this world is sleeping
From darkness comes forever beauty

Awake all alone...
memories are lost
like tears in the rain
My shattered soul has fallen down

When night is turning to the dawn
I don't want to be alone
my blackened faith is broken
I watch reflections of my life

Like a ghost I am...
I stare into the darkess
my thoughts are fateful
they break me down and make me see the dark

Waiting for a dream...
Those ghosts come again
in darkness and the rain
my shattered soul has fallen down again

When night is turning to the dawn
I don't want to be alone
my blackened faith is broken
I watch reflections of my life

When night is turning to the dawn
I don't want to be alone
my blackened faith is broken
I watch reflections of my lifeAhh-ahh-ahh-ah
See I've been working on a jailbreak
Got no time for a mistake
Any moment until the day breaks
No more time to get to know you
I've been working on a jailbreak
Keep it calm with the fast pace
Any moment until the day breaks
No more time to get to know you
Now I'm living in a dream (Ah-ah)
Now I'm living in a dream(ah-ah)
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up

And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up
Ah-ah
See, I've been working on a jailbreak
Got no time for a new thing
Any moment they'll replace me
Should have tried to get to know you
I've been working on my timing
Insecurity beside me
But you tasted so inviting
Should have tried to get to know you
Now I'm living in a dream (Ah-ah)

Momma, it's a jailbreak, it's a, it's a jailbreak
Momma, it's a jailbreak, it's a, it's a jailbreakThere was a time when I could speak to the Lord
A burning heart that made a real mystery unfold
I won't remember what is lost in tug of greed
In an ideal world that was made for me to see
It creates the atmosphere of fear
Pain, lots of pain come into my ears
Drown slowly in the river of tears
True enemies are drawing near
Screams of agony within this violent storm
The day the child died, the day he was born
Souls of dead gather waiting for this judgement day
Glory of this sacred day fades to gray
The only thing is, but it's always failed
Never ends, returns everyday
At the final gate, some began to pray
To get ready for doomsday
The power and protection
Belief in Jesus's resurrection
It haven't supported, helped us ever
Our souls are damned forever
I Joined those whose life departed, that'll be my doom
No daylight under the unholy darkest moon
Renewal to the highest ultimate degree
The verge on the meaningless, they sent to set it free
It creates the atmosphere of fear
Pain, lots of pain come into my ears
Drown slowly in the river of tears
True enemies are drawing near
Screams of agony within this violent storm
The day the child died, the day he was born
Souls of dead gather waiting for this judgement day
Glory of this sacred day fades to grayIt ain't no mystery
I'm all I have left
I'm pushing back and running you over
I've been thrown down, run around,
Beaten 'til I hit the ground
Telling you right now that it's over
There's no room for mistakes
All the cards are in place
Say what you will but say it to my face
Better back the **** up
Better shut the **** up
I'll do what I want and I'll never give up
 I won't be broken
 I won't be tortured
 I won't be beaten down
 I have the answers
 I take the pressure
 I turn it all around
Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up!
I'm gonna c hange history
Enlighten the world
Teach them how to see through my eyes
I'm gonna lash back, check that
Treat it as a heart attack
Stomp out all the ugliest lies
You can't convince me to change
We get on the same page
Oh, I've had my fill now there's nothing but rage
Best get out of my way
Cause there's nothing to say
Is that all that you got?
Because I ain't got all day
I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around
Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up!
I won't be broken
I won't be tortured

Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up to fly away
Lift me up to fly away
Lift me up!They told me lies:
There'll be no Eden nights
And thousand stars
Will sleep in emptiness
I once believed
In words of human world
But they can not guide me,
Not anymore
When life is gone and all is dead
You can not see me one last time
Where light will fade and time has come
This darkness takes the place of life
When time has come
This light will fade away
My thoughts are dark,
My dreams will die away
There is no light
In my shattered life
I this ground
In silence
When life is gone and all is dead
You can not see me one last time
Where light will fade and time has come
This darkness takes the place of life
When life is gone and all is dead
You can not see me one last time
Where light will fade and time has come
This darkness takes the place of lifeStill searching in dark city nights
Unknown places, where should I start
I'm lost and alone in the future world
Out on the streets again, out on my own
Just like always, nowhere to go
Out on the streets again, fighting my war
On the streets where I belong
I carry an axe on my back
Got no shelter when they attack
I'm waiting prepared in the neon lights
Out on the streets again, out on my own
Just like always, nowhere to go
Out on the streets again, fighting my war
On the streets where I belong
I'm out on the streets in the night
I'm out on the streets in the night
I'm out on the streets in the night
Out on the streets again, out on my own
Just like always, nowhere to go
Out on the streets again, fighting my war
On the streets
Out on the streets again, out on my own
Just like always, nowhere to go
Out on the streets again, fighting my war
On the streets
where I belong
where I belongThis ship is sinking deeper and deeper
We've abandoned this vessel and left the captain for dead
Waves thirst for our passing, waves thirst for our passing
Prepare for the struggle, prepare to engage
Our armor tight to the skin, this shield it bears his name
We are strapped to the teeth
But our swords are lodged tightly in our throats
We are going under
We cannot swim under these conditions
We're drowning quicker and quicker
We cannot swim, we cannot swim
We can't swim under these conditions
We are drowning quicker and quicker
We cannot swim, we cannot swim under these conditions
We have become what we have feared
We have become what we have feared
Being one with this world
We've become one with this world
Pray for heaven's titans to rain down, spare us the pain
We're going under, we're going under
Pray for heaven's titans to rain down, spare us the pain
We're going under, we're going under, under, under, underPrincess of lust
Dignity put to dust

A virginal sight
Their apple to bite
Drink from my thighs
The rain of lies
A sight so cursed
Breasts which never nursed

An Aphrodite for mortal souls

Playing hide and seek in lecherous roles
Their erotic hour my tearless weep
Their satisfaction my infinite sleep

Naked limbs reflecting from the moon
I'll be there for you soon
First wish for this night:
Let me be your delight
Body of a virgin
Soul to the Devil's kin

Your God is me
In all that you see

I wait here forever just to

to see you smile

cause it's true

I am nothing without you

I've made my mistakes
I'll stumble and fall

What happened to you
You played the victim for so long now in this game
What I thought was true
Is made of fiction and I'm following the same
But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in
I'm not sure where I should begin
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
Now I'm in over my head
for something I said
completly misread i'm better off dead
and now i can see how fake you can be
this hypocracy's begining to get to me
it's none of my concern
dont look to me 'cause i dont believe in fame
i guess you never heard i met our makers they dont even know your name
but if i had to say goodbye to leave this hell
and say my time has searved me well
i'm fallin'
i'm fallin'
and now i'm in over my head
with somethin i said competly misread i'm better off dead
and now i cant see how fake you can be this hypocracy's begining to get to
this came long before those who suffer more
i'm too awake for this to be a nightmare
what's with my discrase i've lost the human race
no one plans for it to low up in their face

who said it was easy to put back all these pieces
who said it was easy to put back all these pieces
and now i'm in
over my head with somethin i said
completly misread i'm better off dead
and now i can see how fake you can be
this hypocracy's begining to get to me
Over My Head （Better Off Dead）Trying to find a way
Getting better every day
And I got you now I'm not alone
All i need in this life is one,
One thing to believe in

I've seen many a face
From young and too old
I've stolen their faith and I have broken their souls
Was here before Christ had forgave you your sins
And paid your price and sealed your fate within
Days have come to an end
Today's the day that we meet again
The self inflicted inebriation guilt never lies

I've been waiting for the chance to reunite this increment
Poison never hurt so good
So nice of you to speak of me
Your closest friend and enemy
An only savior of masochists
Well its the dead end slave
From the altar to the grave
It's the last days of our life
The faith of men

Time, its been so long
And now there's nothing to say
I'm trying so hard to find the words to say
I'm tired of being, now I'm something I'm not
I can't believe and I never thought
Days would come to an end
Well maybe someday we'll meet again
If ever that day never comes
It would be too soon
My love

I've been waiting for the chance to nullify this increment
Pull the cord to detonate
So sick of you don't speak of me
No represent of misery
An only savior of masochists
Well its the dead end slave
From the alter to the grave
It's the last days of our life
Well its the dead end slave
From the alter to the gray
It's the last days of our life
The faith of men

Now I've found a way
Getting better every day
And I got you now I'm not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in

Trying to find a way
Getting better every day
And I got you now I'm not alone

the silent touch of vivid grace.
your hand fits mine like a perfect match.
we kids in lust and the night is young
the dance we share will guide the way.
the unforgettable romance.
you whisper "hope" like no one else.
but only for tonight.
i am the bullet in your gun
you've had me loaded since the day one
so play your cards right girl,
this beating heart is yours to break!
this soldier surrenders,
don't hesitate now,
this is what you wanted all along.
with steady hands she makes her aim - oh oh oh-
she locks and loads are you in her way?
her smile hits the mark.
she has those gorgeous piercing eyes,
red coloured lips that suck you dry
she is so fashion!
her words might seem to make things right,
but she will walk on your hopes and dreams tonight.
she is so fashion, deadly fashion!
she's been the talk of our town.
so we all know that her words are poison
she'll fake a smile when the timing right
but that cunt will stab you in the back
her eyes are set to make the top.
she spread legs like a swing-door opens up
my bad, i started this rumour,
that you sell your mouth for a dollar!
and if i know her right, that precious little whore,
she's on her back screaming out for more.
so if i know her right, that precious little whore,
she's screaming,she's screaming,she's screaming.
with steady hands she makes her aim - oh oh oh-
she locks and loads, are you in her way?
her smile hits the mark
with steady hands she makes her aim - oh oh oh-
she locks and loads, are you in her way?
her smile hits the mark
you better shake-shake-shake your body!
to the beat that we're making
you better shake-shake-shake your body!
to the music that we're spreading
you better dance-dance-dance forever
you're only pretty when you're sweating
you better shake-shake-shake you body
as we sing to you!
as we sing to you!
as we sing to you!
you always try to get everyone's attention
yet you always fail in each and every way tonight作曲 : Charon, Leppäluoto
come along with the whispering cold and fall
they left you nothing more to seek from here
so roll
the feast
in
flames unforgettable
take a bow to the end,
reload your remorse
every line is a thorn bite through your eyes
still remains
the everlasting hope for a bitter war
if it has made you colder
turning your life for justice
they have learned to obey
broken the rules i followed,
burning for name so hollow
i will learn to obey
among the weak and heartless
i can breath the air veiled just like them
still remains
the everlasting hope for a bitter war
if it has made you colder
turning your life for justice
they have learned to obey
if it has made you colder
turning your life for justice
they have learned to obey

if it has made you colder
turning your life for justice
they have learned to obey
broken the rules i followed
burning for name so hollow
i will learn to obey
if it has made you colder
（if it has made you colder）
（they have learned to obey）
（they have learned to obey）
broken the rules i followed
（broken the rules i followed）
（i will learn to obey）Life will prevail
As long as the sun still rises
And the sun still sets
My heart will beat and I will survive
And I will never be alone again
There comes a day when you need to stand up
And shrug away all doubt inside
Stand strong and push it away
One day you're in one day you're out
It's called the circle of life
But I know you rack them up
Then I'll keep on swingin'
Can you see the sun going down
Before your eyes?
The warmth from the lights that slowly fades out
You're alone tonight
You buried your heart six feet underground
I hate to say this but
You've lost yourself too many times
And I will not be your comfort
When it suits your heart
I'm not alone. I'm stonger. I'm wiser than
I ever was with you. So take your ******* shit
And leave
There's nothing but a hole in your chest
You scandalous bitch
Can you see the sun going down
Before your eyes?
The warmth from the lights that slowly fades out
You're alone tonight
You buried your heart six feet underground
There were millions of times each day
That I thought of you
But we grew up to be nothing like the way
That you said
I feel apart when the pieces you stole from me
Made me lost and incomplete
These heavy hearts won't bring me down
We were the ones
Who would die on the battle ground
At the end of the road I will overcome
You are not me. You will never be this strong
These heavy hearts won't bring me down
We were the ones
Who would die on the battle ground
At the end of the road I will overcome
You are not me. You will never be this strongRhythm of wings in the sky so high
Music in my ears I can't wait to see
I' m hiding in the grass death in my hands
Surprise is my only defence
My private war against wilderness
Human mastermind versus animal instinct
And when the flock settles I pass my sentence
But none will die after the report
They rise into the air and fly away
But they will return
And I am all alone
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Still some day I'm hiding again
Waiting for the sound of stroking wings
And they will come spirit within
And in same place I miss them again
They rise into the air
And fly away
Yeah, they rise into the air
But...they will return!作词 : Rage Against The Machine

All I see is shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
(I can't look away)
From all this pain in the world we made
Everyday you need a bulletproof vest
Just save yourself from what you could never guess
(Am I safe today)
When I step outside in the wars we wage
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown
Sound it off, this is a call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution
Unite and fight to make a better life
Everybody, one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight we rise
Rise
Tonight we rise
Rise
Tonight we rise
Rise
Like a hand grenade thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos trying to escape the flame
(Yesterday is gone)
Faster than the blast of a comet
And when the scars heal the pain passes
The smoke burns, we rise from the ashes
(Darkness fades away)
And the light shines on a brand new day
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown
Sound it off, this is a call
Rise in revolution

Sometimes it's crazy
Crazy to fight for what you believe
But you can't give up

If you want to keep what you love

Spirit, let's hear it
We are possessed
We're all ****ed in the head
Alone and depressed
But if we sing along
A little ****ing louder
To a happy song
Maybe we'll forget cos'
Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
Cos' the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess
Of hate and unrest
So lets all sing along
A little god damn louder
To a happy song
And pretend it's all ok
Let's go!

So sing along
Let's sing along
A little ****ing louder
A little ****ing louder
Well, 'till you feel so much better

Bury me, just leave me to sleep in the dirt
Finish me, I'm floating away
There's a demon staring straight through your eyes
Am I wasting my time?
Something's dying inside of me
You make me feel like I'm ****ing drowning
(I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out)
You made my world come crashing down around me
(I need to cut you out)
Oh God I wish you'd just speak to me
Black is all that I see
Speak to me
You used to be all that I needed
I've been crucified and hung out to dry
Yet my heart still beats and I feel so alive
This time I'll fight for myself as you try to **** me over
I bet you never cared, I knew you never cared
You make me feel like I'm ****ing drowning
(I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out)
You made my world come crashing down around me
(I need to cut you out)
Speak to me
Black is all that I see
Speak to me
You used to be all that I needed
I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out
I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out
I wish you could save me, there's something lost inside
I'm scared it might kill me
All my life I've needed you with me
You've always let me down
But still I try
Don't leave me here
I need you around (Don't turn your back on me)
Lift my feet off the ground (I can't cut you out)
Your tongue like a knife
Your eyes cut like daggers
I don't feel a thing ’cause I'm so dead inside
Lift my feet off the ground
Don't leave me here
I need you aroundWhat's you're doing out in the night time
Won't you call me on the phone
Your mama can't solve your problem
When's daddy ever get home

So you think you're a little bit wild
In the middle of the suicide

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

No one there to hold you
No one is your friend
You live life up and down now
Nightmares on your brain

Another lonely way of hanging round
Don't you take it falling down no no

Hold on hold on tight
I'll make everything all right
Wake up don't go asleep
I'll pray the lord
Your soul to keep
...
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullabyWe don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore (We don't, we don't)
What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to do
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)

What kind of dress you're wearing tonight (Oh)
If he's holding onto you so tight (Oh)
The way I did before
We don't talk anymore (I overdosed)
Should've known your love was a game (Oh)
Now I can't get you out of my brain (Woah)
Oh, it's such a shame
We don't talk anymoreLet's make something clear
We're recording this as it happens
Those diamond bullets, storefront blood banks
Splinters and stained glass
Don't need to move a single prayer bone
Dodge bullets so loud and so low
Don't need to move a single prayer bone
Our death is still life
So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?
So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?
We know where you ****ing live
We know where you ****ing live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognise your corpse
The world was stripped of the superficial stuff he says
We don't intend to just eat the street
The asphalt is the good meat
And we will sleep on the skin of his nightmares
We will sleep on the skin of his nightmares
Time to just kill this clown, scream this ****in' loud
We know where you ****ing live

We'll burn it down, burn it down

Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrowned
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
shine me when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me
They're calling, calling, calling me
Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope they'll still breathing
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unknown place
The only time I feel safe
they're calling, calling, calling me
shine me when I'm alone?
whoa oh oh oh whoa
oh yeah!
Solo
You shine them when I'm alone
Dreaming when they're goneAre you ready?

She got a corpses

and the silence reach the woods, I awake and rise...
Into the night I wander, like many nights before,
and like in my dreams, but centuries ago.
Under the Moon, under the trees.
Into the Infinity of Darkness,
beyond the light of a new day,
into the frozen nature chilly,
beyond the warmth of the dying Sun.
Hear the whispering of the wind,
the Shadows calling...
I gaze into the Moon which grants me visions
these twelve full Moon nights of the year,
and for each night the light of the holy disciples fades away.
Weaker and weaker, one by one.
Weaker and weaker, one by one.
I gaze into the Moon which makes my mind pure as crystal lakes,
my eyes cold as the darkest winter nights, by yet there is a flame inside.
It guides me into the dark shadows beyond this world,
into the infinity of thoughts... thoughts of upcoming reality.
In the name of the almighty Emperor I will ride the Lands in pride,
carrying the Blacksword at hand, in warfare.
I will grind my hatred upon the loved ones.
Despair will be brought upon
the hoping children of happiness.
Wherever there is joy the hordes of the eclipse
will pollute sadness, sadness and hate
under the reign of fear.
The lands will grow black.
There is no Sunrise yet to come
into the wastelands of phantoms lost.
The lands will grow black.
There is no Sunrise yet to come.
May these moments under the Moon be eternal.
May the infinity haunt me... In Darkness.Smells like a freak show
Right where I want to be
Come taste the dirt,
The dirt, the dirt
I...
I smell a freak show
Theres something wrong with me
Want it to hurt
It hurts, it hurts
I...
I need something to sedate me
But I can't afford the high
Give me something
To help me escape
Smells like a freak show
God in a casket
Gone for eternities
We've got no rules,
No rules, no rules
I...
God in a casket
Lost all authority
Come watch the fools
The fools, the fools
I...
I need something to sedate me
But I can't afford the high
Give me something
To help me escape
Smells like a freak show
I need something to sedate me
But I can't afford the high
Give me something
To help me escape
Smells like a freak show作曲 : Konstantinos Karamitroudis/Haralampos Katsionis

It’s about that time, gotta stake your claim
And do what you’ve gotta do, get right into their face
But the game is changing, who could ever know
What is going on right now? Where’d the cowards go?

Wars of ages, turn the pages
Run away, admit defeat

The fire and winds won’t bring down Salamis
A thousand ships can’t save you
Your forces rise to bring down Salamis
But no one’s going to hear those feeble cries

Put your best man in, let him show him the way
You can’t stop now, there’s too much at stake
Now the tides are changing, on the dark blue sea
Take your men and regroup now, find your destiny
Wars of ages, turn the pages
Run away, admit defeat

The fire and winds won’t bring down Salamis
A thousand ships can’t save you
Your forces rise to bring down Salamis
But no one’s going to hear those feeble cries

We were lost in shadows of night
And often we cry...
All this time we went to death
And now we came to this
The ending is so close
But we were lost in shadows...
We were lost in shadows of night
And how much we not fight
We'll die alone in our world
And it wholly our fault
The fear of loneliness makes death more painfully
The ending is so close
But we were lost in shadows...
We were lost in shadows of night
And how much we not fight
We'll die alone in our world
And it wholly our fault

What make you try
and stay in the illusion?
What make you blind
and die for temptation?
I'm just afraid of the things
That I've known
Just cry it out, more and more

We walk away to another land of death
Searching for the beautiful thing to heal
Let me feel you all the inside
With the Secret love we have

Our fear will have no more
Face to the one who hate us all
Take me away from this life
With your secret love

What make you try

as this last breath leaves me
I am trying to be
what you're dying to see
I feel like "**** man,
can't take this, anymore,
this heart, break this."
This is life that's so thankless,
How could he just forsake us?
racist he makes us
hate us he gave us
nothing but no trust
and I am so ****ed up
So let this gun bind us
Lets hide by this lust
and once we are just dust
he'll know that he loved us
Let it all burn, I will burn first
God of time, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve.
God of mine, am I lost in your eyes?
So take me and make me
weakened and save me
this hate that you gave me
keeps saying the same thing
to sing when you hurtin'
to sing when you cry
to sing when you livin'
to sing when you die
and here at the end
at the end of the hurt
all the pain ain't the same
when it's your turn to burn
We're the heart for the heartless,
the thoughts for the thoughtless,
the means for the end,
we're the gods of the deadless!
Let it all burn
I will burn first
God of time, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn
It's what I deserve
God of mine, am I lost in your eyes?
So cry 3 tears for me,
burning so good,
sing me this song
So cry 3 tears for me,
burning so good,
burning so good
I can not stand
who i am I'm this man
with this blood on my hands
in this blood I am damned
so watch my wings burn
as they burn in the fire
I'll scatter the ashes
now sing for the choir
Let it all burn,
I will burn first
God of time, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn
it's what I deserve,
God of mine, am I lost in your eyes?
This hate that you gave me keeps saying
Just let me burn,
Just let me burn
This hate that you gave me keeps saying
Just let me burn,
Just let me burn
Burn
NOW
Burn
Just let me burn
NOW
Burn
BURN!Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand
Fools like me, who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's command?
A country that's divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be in your homelands
Holy wars
Upon my podium, as the
Know it all scholar
Down in my seat of judgement
Gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader
Out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier
Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God
Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
Behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die.they die
They killed my wife, and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake...last mistake!
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
Next mistake...no more mistakes!
Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't
thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings.
mercy killings.
mercy killings.
killings.
killings.
killings.
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts awayA made up army a made up act
That's how they roll and others fall

It's like a masquerade - they all wear masks

The play's just started it's almost done

Some say it's real others it's fake

A clever setup without a trace

That's what we hear That's what we see

That's what they think people need

This is false flag

An act of anger, fully disguised

This is false flag

We've been deceived, some have been killed

No one cares to find out the truth

Since television brings it to you

So don't stop thinking don't let it go

You know they're hungry, they'll ask for more

The flag is waving up on the wind
It's up to you whom to salute

That's what they think

People always needI know you’ll be there
To see the tables turning
Wake up tomorrow
And watch the bridges burning
I can see  I can see it in your eyes
I can feel  I can feel it in my mind
I don’t care  I don’t care if you realize
What you see  What you see in my eyes
I’m over me being and under you
I’m breaking free I’m breaking through
I’ve overcome all I’m underneath
I can finally stand
I can finally breathe
Remember when we
First had the thought of living
A perfect picture
But I did all the giving
Gave up my passions
To try to make you happy
The joke is over
And I’ll do all the laughing
I can see  I can see it in your eyes
I can feel  I can feel it in my mind
I don’t care  I don’t care if you realize
What you see  What you see in my eyes
I’m over me being and under you
I’m breaking free I’m breaking through
I’ve overcome all I’m underneath
I can finally stand
I can finally breathe
Finally breathe

I can see  I can see it in your eyes
I can feel  I can feel it in my mind
I don’t care  I don’t care if you realize
What you see  What you see in my eyes
I’m over me being and under you
I’m breaking free I’m breaking through
I’ve overcome all I’m underneath
I can finally stand
I can finally breatheBehold the signs of the never-ending war,
the furious screams of the gods
As the nightfall sets to the distance,
the blood of the warriors light the sky
This moment is ready to be ruined,
by those who dishonor the blade
As he looks into their eyes he sees fear;
the bleeding wounds are no excuse
No Excuse!
Even those who lead the way,
show fear in their hearts
Time has come for the One to rise
to show where courage is, when it can't be found
The birth of the child of war,
the one who will define the way,
for those who shall be carrying the blade till the end of days
Fate only smiles to the wise,
who put themselves aside
Who are ready to die, embrace the form
of honor in its purest form,
the honor of dying,
as you're holding the sword
Fight!
Like the last man in the night,
holding the front alone, and the
Fear!
Shall be no more if the one's prepared
to hold the sword
Hold the sword!
Fight!
Like the last man in the night,
holding the front alone, and the
Fear!
Shall be no more if the one's prepared
to hold the sword
Hold the sword!
Tales shall be written in his honor,
his cause will define a man.
The strongest of all will bow to him, the child of the god of war.For many years we lived in peace
The kingdom of Reindhill And Heelh we were unite
But soon it all would end
We held the key to a better world
The sun and the moon were united in one force
Everyone were free
Tears of an angel
They're crying then I know
This is the end of our perfect harmony
In the great hall of ReinXeed
The Langarin still lies
We have come to set it free
The spirit will not die
I can not see
How such cruelty can win
If there is a god
Then he will help me
Fight and win!
Riff
Trough the storm I heard them say
The land of Heelh was no longer in their hands
The time has come for us to go
How could we know?
A flower called Langarin
Where sent from above
To heal the power in our heart
Now it is gone
It's been locked inside the temple wall
Is this the end of our perfect harmony?
In the great hall of ReinXeed
The Langarin still lies
We have come to set it free
The spirit will not die
I can not see
How such cruelty can win
If there is a god
Then he will help me
Fight and win!
Riff

Fight and win!See the writings on the wall
A new age has to come
It's the message we've sent to you


In this night, aware of the kingdom come
Resistance enlightens the faculties

What is worth fighting for?
It's our vision of paradise!
Call to arms
We will fight
Comrades, now is the time to strike

We've lost our wisdom
We've lost our wealth
Infestation that crippled the lore

I,I  am  the  one  who  lost  control  but  in  the  end  I'll  be  the  last  man  standing,
I,I  am  the  one  who  sold  his  soul  forever  come  to  be  the  last  man  standing  tall.
Glorious,noble  in  my  mind  everything  I  fight  to  win,taking
all  and  giving  whatever  my  pride  would  let  me,
not  backing  down  not  giving  in  I  wouldnt  lose  I  couldnt  die,
I,I  am  the  one  who  lost  control  but  in  the  end  I'll  be  the  last  man  standing,
I,I  am  the  one  who  sold  his  soul  forever  come  to  be  the  last  man  standing  tall.
I  walk  alone,with  my  head  held  high  never  felt  that  I  belong,
stand  my  ground  at  all  costs  running  through  life  with  blindfolds
just  for  the  right,right  to  be  wrong,
nothing  would  rule  my  world  but  I.
I,I  am  the  one  who  lost  control  but  in  the  end  I'll  be  the  last  man  standing,
I,I  am  the  one  who  sold  his  soul  forever  come  to  be  the  last  man  standing  tall.
Nothing  would  rule  my  world  but  I,
I,I  am  the  one  who  lost  control  but  in  the  end  I'll  be  the  last  man  standing
I,I  am  the  one  who  sold  his  soul  forever  come  to  be  the  last  man  standing

Seeing  clearer  what  I ’ve  done
I ’d  refuse  to  let  things  go
I  could  never  once  admit  I ’m  wrong
And  what  do  I  have  to  show?
Seeing  clearer  what ’s  at  stake
And  the  things  I  have  to  change
I  just  hope  I  can,it ’s  not  too  late
To  get  a  chance  to  end  this  painAgony is the price
That you'll pay in the end

Domination consumes you
Then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel
And manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget
When there's nothing else
Left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall

Those words that stare
Into your soul

And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination

pushed into living hell

Domination

a now blacked heart
Is reaching out in divinity

Body suspended by chains over razors and nails
It's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of your life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end
Forcing you to bend
Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall

Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination

pushed into living hell

Domination作曲 : Kokko, Kokko
Moon Of My Nights
I thought I knew who you were
But I didn't know myself
Didn't see the things hidden
In my hollowness
Didn't peep round the curtain
Of your exterior
And the crack turned into an edge
That opens between
Listen to the wind singing in the grass,My love
As you lay yourself down to rest
Listen to the cry of the river in autumn cold,My dear
Before I close the gates deep down inside
You were...
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
Those secrets that I revealed
Buried in icy bosom
Those words that I've spoken
Taken by the dawn
The strings that were connected
Separated parts left
Read are the rhymes of story
Of the endless poet
Listen to the wind,singing in the grass,My love
As you lay yourself down to rest
Listen to the cry of the river In autumn cold,My dear
Before I close the gates deep down inside
You were...
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights

You were the moon of my nights
And you know you were the moon of my nights
Moon of my nights

You were...
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nightsGet me some division,
called the dead by night to the god,
Allay the chaos,
Chains to my last victim!

Set up the lights on the way to the skies,
Raising my sword to the lord!
Calling your death in a black obsession,
The only way.

WoooWww!!!

So wait for salvation.
Coming to me!
Life to the saint.
Life for me!

Your lord,
Who smashed this bloody god on earth,
Is tonight by my side,
Take me to the place to die for you,
And give me life in flames!

It's black after light,
An Odyssey of the end,
A lord of chaos to be,
Searching my dreams of the lives in my vision
It's a night of war, YEAH!

The son of the night was Left to destroy,
I wait now to destroy...

Say,Why this bloody god on earth,
Is always by my side,
Take me to the place where I die for you.

YAAAAAWWWW!!!!

The last song of hate,
Is a song to my heart.
Tonight's gonna be,
Something wild!作词 : Laiho
Death be not proud
though some have called me mighty and dreadful
thou art not so
Loosing the war I am feining to win
though I never tried to to strive deep
from within. Life could be beautiful
for anybody it is for,
The portal has been past
to follow the reaper
When your blindly death-raying blade
sweeps the griefs and fears away.
I cross my heart
I cross my heart
Sinking down in the ocean of severe emotions.
Grab a bottle to drink up the pain-reliefing potion.
But after all, that got boring too,
so no matter,what happens, I could not give a damn or too.
The portal has been past til the point of no return.
No more lines to cross,
no bridges to burn.
Now when your blindly death-raying blade
swept my griefs and tears away.
I would never go back to cross that line.
I cross my heart and hope to die.
speaking  I was only 21 when I died.Burn
The fire will light the path
Trade for the nightfall
The pattern is so predictable
Another reason to dream in the moment
Not be denied
I'm not a product of circumstance
Or a name in a line

Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
It's this sheltered life that you're living
Try to recognise
Your choked up words
Are empty still
Fight Blood in the throne room
It's over
These towers fall
Blood in the throne room
It's over
This towers fall
Your lies
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
We're alone

Fear is the change
That brings you down
Blood in the throne room
It's over, it's over
Mirror my lesson learned
Tailored for reason
Laid to rest your lies无歌词Driven utav hämndbegär
Har jag tänkt ut min karriär
I kitteln kokar oljan het
Dess doft förtäljer min hemlighet
Jag ska förgifta vattnet först
Och skratta när ni dör av törst
Sedan sticker jag oljan i brand
Så alla faller för min hand
Dieseldöd
När dieseldagen äntligen gryr
Skall jag med glädje se hur mina fiender flyr
Och jag ska erkännas till sist
Som terroristernas terrorist
Dieseldöd
Dieseldöd - dricker terpentin och diesel dör en
Dieseldöd - i ångor och i nöd
Men vem skall då hedra mina storverk och dåd
Då alla förgåtts och dräpts utan nåd?
Mitt magnum opus väntar ej
Och hatet brinner hett i mig
Då insikt gett mig mod till dygd

The snowbed stories' winter grey
Wildflowers' those meadows of heaven'
Wind in the wheat

A railroad across waters'
The scent of grandfatherly love
Blue bayous' Decembers'
Moon through a dragonfly's wings

Where's dear Alice knocking on the door?
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there?
Where the real is shattered by a Mad March Hare?
Where is the wonder? where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me

Flickering chains of doleful regret

Used and abused just barely breathing
A chemical addiction in shape of a man

Fractal crimson red

Manipulatin' every breath

Waitin' for the final blow
D-E-A-D
Flowin' down my throat...
And still I'm cravin' for more

I've seen the world in shades of red
I've seen the future it looks so dead
A forlorn cry to the endless mist
A shallow grave down into the abyss
I've seen the spectre of another sun
Two steps ahead and six feet beyond
I've seen the glory in a plastic sack
Dispatched home for a grave to erect

Massacre's rivers flowing bloodred
Funeral fumes the stench of the dead
A ravenous thirst devouring my soul
The echoes of war lost far in the cold

The sky is turning redInto the blackness where our minds can flee the real life
Behind the curtain there´s a place where we can all hide
Here live the dark ones we are standing side by side
Towards the night we raise our arms
Into the afterworld we ride
Beyond the wonders
The time has come
To join our forces
And be as one
Beyond the wonders
We all stand tall
And regret nothing
From dusk till dawn
Escape the fright;
the presence of diabolic silence
Here is redemption,
here is our own asylum
Beyond the wonders
The time has come
To join our forces
And be as one
Beyond the wonders
We all stand tall
And regret nothing
From dusk till dawn
Inside the red inferno
Another hunt is on
I`ll take you to the other side
Where you will never be alone
Beyond the wonders
The time has come
To join our forces
And be as one
Beyond the wonders
We all stand tall
And regret nothing
From dusk till dawnThere's a storm heading our way
All that's been well be gone
All your cities will sink into the ocean
You run away like cattle
But you cannot flee the battle
Wipe your ass. It's time to put on your war paint
Throw the spear
Let your hatred fly
Throw the spear
Let your hatred fly
The desert is my prophet
As our lives end by the minute
Stand up straight and ****ing put on your war paint
Time to die
Hammer high
Name your price
And kneel
Hail the apocalypse
All flesh is equal when burnt
We are forgiven
Forgive us we never shall learn
Get down
Hail the apocalypse
Once you built
Now you run away
The world is coming down
Leave your mark upon the graves of your stillborn
Just wrap it up in plastic
Isn't killing things fantastic?
**** your greed
Come on and put on your war paint
Die
Hammer high
Name your price
And kneel
Hail the apocalypse
All flesh is equal when burnt
We are forgiven
Forgive us we never shall learn
Get down
Hail the apocalypse
All the lords I've sworn to obey
All the lords I've sworn to obey
I take it back
All the lords I've sworn to obey
All the lords I've sworn to obey
I take it back
Hail the apocalypse
All flesh is equal when burnt
We are forgiven
Forgive as we never shall learn
Get down

Carefully watching each and every step I take.
Bright white straight jacket chokes me off.

Like... binding pleasure of being dead.

Downward future! I descend...

It`s not like I made myself a list
Of new anddifferent ways to murder your heart
I`m just a painting that`s still wet
If you touch me, I`ll be smeared
You`ll be stained
Stained for the rest of your life
So turn around, walk away
Before you confuse the way we abuse each other
You`re not afraid of getting hurt
And I`m not afraid of how much I hurt you
I`m well aware I`m a danger to myself
Are you aware I`m a danger to others?
There`s a crack in my soul
You thought it was a smile
Whatever doesn`t kill you…
Is gonna leave a scar
Whatever doesn`t kill you…
Is gonna leave a scar
I`m more like a silver bullet
And I’m like a gun, not easy to hold
I`m moving fast and if I stay inside your heart
I`m certain that this will be
The end of your life
So turn around, walk away
Before you confuse the way we abuse each other
You`re not afraid of getting hurt
And I`m not afraid of how much I hurt you
I`m well aware I`m a danger to myself
Are you aware I`m a danger to others?
There`s a crack in my soul
You thought it was a smile
Whatever doesn`t kill you…

Whatever doesn`t kill you will leave a scar

You＇ll take my life but I＇ll take yours too
You＇ll fire your musket but I＇ll run you through
So when you＇re waiting for the next attack
You＇d better stand there＇s no turning back.
The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won＇t live to fight another day.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below.
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body＇s numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh作曲 : Pantera
ooooh come on
Under the lights where we stand tall
Nobody touches us at all
Showdown shootout spread fear within without
We're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back
You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're takin over this town
Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen my friend you see

Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell

Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon your doom
Comin'for you we're the cowboys from hell
Pillage the village trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
From my double barrel 12gauge
Can't lock me in your cage
You see us comin'

To take you away
Make you repay
For your sins
Once you sworn
To live by the rues

Failed this game

I've been there
And now I've coming back for you
Living my life in sin
I'm the crucifire
In the name of the cross
Crucifire
Feel the hatred of a
Blackened soul
A heart once lost in the fire
Nowhere to run
You're out of control
You're under my spell now
So welcome to hell
Can you see what lies behind
The gates of hell
I've been there
And now I've coming back for you
Living my life in sin
I'm the crucifire
In the name of the cross
Crucifire
Forgive me father for I have sin
My heaven have become your hell
And forever you will burn

I'm not that innocent.i crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
now i'm near the altar the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun light the dragon's eyes
on the way to the glory i'll honor my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
finally happened the sun fit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
thanks to hidden mirrors i found my lost way
over the stones i reached the place it was a secret cave
in a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
for the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
i will search for the emerald sword
only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honor to be kissed by the sun
yes, i'm that warrior i followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul i can reach the sword
on the way to the glory i'll honor my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
for the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
i will search for the emerald sword
for the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord

I Want My Tears Back Now!作词 : DeMaio, Logan
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die
Quit my job this morning
Said forever I would hold my head up high
'Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From the hall, I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me "brother"
Said, "My friends are over there"
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die

（Hold your head up high
 Raise your fist up in the air
 Play metal louder than hell
 Louder than hell
 They can't stop us
 Let 'em try
 For heavy metal

Burning for the steel

Outcasts, condemned for our beliefs
Our legions grew in secrecy
And now, the time is here
I see the Templars everywhere
The freedom call is drawing near
We hold our rebel banners up with pride
The colour's crimson and the hammer is the sign

Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems, cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light, but girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see so how did this come to be
Arrived too early
And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far
I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear, escape from this afterlife
Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
This peace on earth's not right (With my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind
Gave me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life
I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear, escape from this afterlife
Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope you might
Take me back inside when the time is right
Loved ones back home all crying cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken; I'm choking on this ecstasy)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live)
Guitar Solo
I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear, escape from this afterlife
Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you

Take me back inside when the time is right

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
Drop dead a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say its up: to me
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
Ignorance and Understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But whos left? To start the pleading
How far will we take this
It's not hard to see through the sickness
So tell me what would you say
I'd say its up: to me
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this is worthless
What have we done
We're in a war that can't be won
This can't be real
I don't know what to feel
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating

As I penetrate your soul
Feel the fire shoot through your body
As I slip into your throne
Cast aside, do as you will
I care not how you plead
Satan's child now stalks the earth
Born from my demon seed

Hot winds of Hell
Burns, in my wake
Death is what you pray,
Behold, captor of sin

Infernal slaves of manipulation
Captive of my vice
Abandon God, the helpless one
To relieve you of your plight
Subversive action will not help
It will strengthen me
I see decline in your every move
Death your final plea

Hot winds of Hell
Burns, in my wake
Death is what you pray,
Behold, captor of sin

Your skin turns to leather
I ignite your timid blood
You feel my lethal touch
As I grasp your weary soul
I'll take you down into the fireHow many ways

undefinedHow did I fall？
How did I come to this ?
I have thought past was a past
Now I'm taking a look into the glass
Searching for a light
some kind of my delight
Which I can't find !
Now I can see myself
In the mirror of my sins !
Wind recalls my deeds
An abstract of my life
All is spoiled and destroyed
Now I see what I have done !
As I stand here, I'm living dead
My heart is black and soul is fading
Is it real ?
Or is it sum of all my fears ?
Now I'm taking a look into the glass
Searching for a light
some kind of my delight
Which I can't find !
Now I can see myself
In the mirror of my sins !
In the mirror In the mirror In the mirror of my sinsyou let me violate you.you let me desecrate you
you let me penetrate you.you let me complicate you
help me i broke apart my insides
help me i've got no soul to sell
help me the only thing that works for me
help me get away from myself,
i want to **** you like an animal
i want to feel you from the inside
i want to **** you like an animal
my whole existence is flawed
you get me closer to god
you can have my isolation.you can have the hate that it brings
you can have my absence of faith.you can have my everything
help me tear down my reason.help me it's your sex i can smell
help me you make me perfect.help me become somebody else
i want to **** you like an animal
i want to feel you from the inside
i want to **** you like an animal
my whole existence is flawed
you get me closer to God
through every forest
above the trees
within my stomach
scraped off my knees
i drink the honey, inside your hive
you are the reason i stay alive无歌词A storm is loosed upon the sea
Whose eye is stained with tears.
A wretch Hell-bound and bent on blood,
the makings of the fearful's fears.
The tide it stole away her grace,
the depths, they wouldn't claim her.
A toil begat by father's blood
This path was laid before her.
Redemption borne by brigand’s blood
A blight upon the darkness.
The pact embraced, a road unsought
The Maiden of Death won't be unwrought.
Her wrath is known throughout the black,
the gardens of death she is tending
Vengeance is her only ward
Beware the blood red rose's thorn.Far away in a distant land
Ten men, weapons close at hand
These men are at war for peace
Outnumbered they are up against all odds
But their spirit is undetered
On the distant cries in the wind
We hear our friends die in agony
We have learnt that we always must stay strong
Relying on each other till the day we die
Are we the only ones left?
So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
Find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
For pride we fight
For pride we die
We've been here for far too long
we haven't eaten in weeks
It's hard to go on
But with each day that slowly passes by
I don't feel like giving in
I'd rather die
Cos this is the way we are born to be
So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
Find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
A Warrior's heart, never dies
Never dies

We gather here, beneath the sky
The days go by and we lose track of time
Watching the seasons pass us by
Sun, wind, snow we've seen it all
But this is how we're born to be
To serve the king is our sworn duty
We fight these wars but why we do not know
A spirit of pride is all we own

So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
A Warrior's heart, never dies
So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
find another way (this is the warrior's way)
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
We fight for pride
We fight for pride
For pride we fight
For pride we die

A thousand years could pass us by
but it'll never change our warrior's pride
Our souls live on in another life
We'll stand together at each others sides
We will fight together and together we die
Cos this is our way
This is who we are
The Warrior's way will live on forever
in the hearts and souls of all who stand together
The spirit lives on, in our song
To the end

We stand defiant
In this great big ugly world
Do believe that the chaos
Was our one true calling
First we muscled fate
Then we brazenly call disorder
Watch the normals cower
They just can't take it anymore
Withstand together now
All the damning from on high
Fist horns are roaring forth
As I scream into the sky
I'm morbid
Morbid and Sordid
Distorted
Bring them to their knees
I'm morbid
Morbid
Won't be thwarted
From celebrating morbid victories
Morbid....
We're seen as monsters, merely being
Is a threat to all
What can't destroy us makes us strong
And in a twisted mind
Oh everything is possible
And in a twist of fate
We make it all come down... Crumbling down
Oh we'll bring them down
We stand invincible not just a dream
Straight from the underground we scream
I'm morbid
Morbid and Sordid
Distorted
Bring them to their knees
I'm morbid
Morbid
Won't be thwarted
From celebrating morbid victories
Morbid.......
We stand invincible not just a dream
Straight from the underground
The Gods are screaming
Tear down the obstacles this is our way
We're born to quake the world
There is no other way

I'm morbid
Morbid well
Bring them to their knees
I'm morbid
Morbid
I'm morbid

If I take my life away
Fall down there and get some shelter
I’m staring at the end 
Of what you put me through
Have you ever had a price to pay ?
Or sold yourself to get a little ride
Have you ever found your place?
The why, a way to live or die
Will you stop your doom ?

Heaven is a lie, a lie
Heaven is a lie, a lie
Heaven is a lie, a lie

All low with the sinking feeling
I suffer to the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies that had cut so deeply
You can't get enough
You take and take and take and never say

NOOOOOO!!!!!
You gonna get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
NOOOOOO!!!!!
You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout, blood in your eye!

You say that it's not your fault
Instead, that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse from the trust you're breaking
You run to the back, you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough
You take and take and take and take and take
**** it, are you listening?
NOOOOOO!!!!!

You gonna get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
NOOOOOO!!!!!
You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
NOOOOOO!!!!!
You gonna get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
NOOOOOO!!!!!
You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout, Blood in your eye!

Blackout, blood in your eye
You push it back down
Push it back down
You push it back down
Blood in your eye
Blackout, blood in your eye
Blackout, blood in your eye

Floating down..
These colors fill the line
We look up from the ground
In fields of paper write
And floating up..
It passes in the night
The future gazing out
A past to overwrite
So come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Come down low
Come down low
Come down low
Come down low
Come down lowThe sun is going down, the curtain's falling
The heat is rising now, the master's calling
Into the night I thunder, into the dead of night
And I will head the calling and leave it all behind
The holy man has lost the grail, signs of love from yesterday
The eyes of god of have turned away, the dream became alive
All my life I've waited for the yearning in my heart
Right out there I see a star, the sun is going down
Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
Drink the poison , listen to your heart
Feed the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel the fire
My heart is crying out, the fever rising
No one can stop me now, it's meserizing
I break the chains that bind me, the chaos in my life
I leave the world behind me and live in my own mind
A holy land, another shore, no more pain and no more war
She's calling me from far away, makes me feel alive
Here I stand in front of her, losing my disguise
No regrets, I'm standing there, waiting for the bite
Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
Drink the poison , listen to your heart
Feed the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel the fire
Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
Feel the poison , flowing through your heart
Kiss the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel her fiery Love
Another life,a different way, signs of life from yesterday
The memory will fade away, the dream became alive
Here I stand in front of you, tearing off the lies
No regrets, I'm standing tall, I now am free to bite
Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
Drink the poison , listen to your heart
Feed the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel the fire
Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
Drink the poison ,listen to your heart
Kiss the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel the fiery Love无歌词One shot heard around the world

Thx for watchingIf I struggle a lifetime
What would my body be?
An empty shell
On what a demon fed!
Could be a heavy burden
To stay true to your words!
Speak up!
I wanna silence everything!
If I got no plan
Doesn't mean that I get what I want for free.
If I got no meaning,
Would you force me to a place where I make sense,
'Cause nothing lasts forever...
How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me!
If I can't find myself?
It's so completely fake!
How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me!
If even you can't help?
Dark nights on my soul!

I deny failure!
I ignite!
Woe is on my misery,
She wins all their eyes!
Realize what defies our fate!
This is not me, this is me!
So if I struggle a lifetime
What good would that do?
If I got a plan
Doesn't have to stop the feeling inside.
If I do make sense,
Would you drag me down,
'Cause nothing lasts forever...
How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me!
If I can't find myself?
It's so completely fake!
How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me!
If even you can't help?
Dark nights on my soul!Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

Now listen to me
We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play what Manowar kill
Kings of metal - kick your ass
Kick your ass - Manowar kill
Comin' to town we gonna- kick your ass
Kings of metal - Manowar kill
Comin' to town we gonna- kick your ass
Kings of metal - Manowar kill
Nanananana - kick your ass
Nanananana - Manowar kill
Kings of metal - kick your ass
Comin' to town - Manowar kill
Comin' to town we gonna- kick your ass
Kings of metal - Manowar killI wanna slit your throat and f**k the wound
I wanna push my face in and feel the swoon
I wanna dig inside find a little bit of me
'Cause the line gets crossed when you don't come clean
My wormwood meets your pesticide
You'll never get out 'cause you were never alive
I am infinite I am the infant finite
Come a little closer and I'll show you why
No one is safe
Noises noises people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing
How does it feel to be locked inside another dream
That never had a chance of being realized
What the f**k are you lookin' at
I'll tell you what you're lookin' at
Everyone you ever f**kin' laughed at
Look in my eyes for the answers typical
I can feel it underneath like a miracle
Everybody in the world needs more than
Lies and consequences to power them
Once again it's me and no one else
I can't remember if there was a someone else
It's not mine it's not fair it's outta my hands
And it's shaking you'll never take me
No one is safe
Noises noises people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing
Hate hate ain't enough to describe me
Scream somewhere between screaming and crying
I'm not supposed to be here I'm not supposed to be
Why when do I get to know why
Bitter bitter as the stink of when I try
I'm not supposed to be here I'm not supposed to be no
Pull your hands away I'm gone
Goodbye it's so depressing withering away
Take a look inside my soul is missing
All I have is dead so I'll take you with me
I feel like I'm erased so kill me just in case
I feel like I'm erased so kill me just in case
So kill me just in case
Covet everything around me's mine
Sty can't see through the sties in my eyes
I'm not supposed to be here I'm not supposed to be
Down scratching and clawing all the way
Stay you won't let me f**king stay
I'm not supposed to be here I'm not supposed to be
Live is there another way to live
Die 'cause it's the only way to die
I'm not supposed to be here I'm not supposed to be come on
No no no
No I'm not supposed to be here I'm not supposed to be
I'm not supposed to be here I'm not supposed to be作曲 : Anna-Varney Cantodea

Chicken poxNightmare! your nightmare comes to

Dragged ya down below' down to the devils show'
To be his guest forever of mind is less than
Hate to twist your mind' but God ain't on your side'
An old acquaintance severed the world your last
Flesh is burning' you can smell it in the air'
Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal

So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head'
you're now a slave until the end of time here'
Nothing stops the madness turning' haunting' yearning' pull the trigger!
You should have known the price of evil'
And it hurts to know that you belong here' yeah
Oooooh' it's your ****in' nightmare!
your nightmare comes to
Can't wake up in sweat' cause it ain't over yet'
still dancin' with your demons of your own
Beyond the will to fight' where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
You've been lied to just to rape you of your site'
and now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel

So sedated as they medicate your brain
and while you slowly go insane the tell ya:
Given with the best intentions help you with your complications!
You should have known the price of evil'
And it hurts to know that you belong here' yeah.
No one to call' everybody to fear'
Your tragic fate is looking so clear' yeah.
Oooooh' it's your ****in' nightmare' ha-ha-ha-ha!
Fight ' not to fail ' not to fall
Or you'll end up like the others.
Die ' die again ' drenched in sin
With no respect for another.

Down ' feel the fire ' feel the hate
Your pain is what we desire.
Lost ' hit the wall ' watch you crawl
Such a replaceable liar.

And I know you hear their voices from
And I know they may seem real signals of
But our life's made up from choices without
They took for granted your soul' and it's ours now to steal

your nightmare comes to
You should have known the price of evil'
And it hurts to know that you belong here' yeah.
No one to call' everybody to fear'
Your tragic fate is looking so clear' yeah
Oooooh' it's your ****ing nightmare!We were supposed to
Take on the world
But every day
Pulled us further...
We've gotten used to
Live in a world
That doesn't want us around
Torn apart...
We have outrun you
So many times
But every fight takes
Another...
Been looking through you
Time after time
We have seen through
All your life
Torn apart...
Torn apart...
Are we
More than just a part?
Are we
Lost right from the start?
Just tell me...
Are we
More than just a part?
Are we
Lost right from the start?
Just tell me...
Torn apart...

The darkest side of your life 
Can't understand the secret, how you survive 
A crystal ball, by your side 
A frightful future, now you describe 
Higher above 
A ball of fire about to fall 
Can't escape, from tomorrow 
A hopeless time rising 
Can't escape, from tomorrow 
Will we arrive 
The finest days of our lives 
There'll be no longer days for us to be alive 
The final chapter has been read 
The time has come to realizeYou feel a sudden pain
The night turns bright as day
This shit is going straight
Out of your mind
You try to feel afraid
It is the price you pay
To get the thrill
You need to stay alive
Let it burn!
Between the cuts and cries
You'll find a way to die
Just take a sip
And twist it like a knife
A city full of sound
Too late to turn around
You need to flee the light
To save your life
You like when it hurts?
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
You ain't sure what came first
Was it your flame or thirst?
You need to please them both
To put you out
Another wasted youth
You thought you'd seen the truth
You need to find a voice
To help you shout
I like when it hurts!
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
I like when it hurts!
Let it burn!you spin me round

Let's skip all the histrionics
Not again not another excuse

The epidemic is codependent
Biting off more than your mouth can chew
Don't forget to convalesce your secrets
I don't want to be a man today
For all that you know I'm the silver in the bullet
I am the trigger that will make you all obey

I'm going to make you cry tonight

I'm going to make you hate me
Inside all my flaws again
I can't let go
In spite of you I'm lost again
I still don't know
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only
The status quo is not a punishment
But now it feels like home

Your association finds you guilty

Started with the end of the day

Black and white is such a fascist feeling

Right or wrong and nothing to say
The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints
Unappreciated medical fiends
Confiscate another classic inbred
**** it all light the acetylene

No other choice I can't explain

Life keeps taking things away
Inside all my flaws again
I can't let go
In spite of you I'm lost again
I still don't know
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only

The status quo is not a punishment
But now it feels like home

The tough guys who came to kill but stayed to rape and ravage

The future's here I'm past my prime
When the evidence came I committed the crime
Can you stand on your faith with your feet on the bible
Who could ask for a better disciple
What's the point I'm not sure I can
I'll never dig another grave I'm afraid of what I'll find
If it hurts then you're too old
I'll take your sh*t and give you ****ing gold

I'm gonna make you cry tonight

I need you to hate me
Inside all my flaws again
I can't let go
In spite of you I'm lost again
I still don't know
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only

The status quo is not a punishment
But now it feels like home

But now it feels like homeBlack

Dirty thief

In the grease

Was the proof too good
To be believed

Is the cunt

With the dumb

Who belongs on broken knees
So far it occurs to me
That everybody in the world
Is afraid of me
Just one more cent
And down we go
Now the news is out
And I think I'm going to
Kill myself

Or f**k myself

Or tell myself

About the only thing
That matters now

We bury what we fear the most

Approaching original violence

Is the silence where you hide it

Cuz I don't recognize you anymore

To each his own

I can do with one less watered
Down excuse

If this is over you can
Tell me it's no use

Use
Just tell me it's over

Today

We will deceive

Our better selves

Into assimilating pain
From something else

Put on your face

And show me why

Behind the scenes
We had to simply comply
Now the community
Doesn't feel any better
Than it used to be
I wanna be a judge
In a criminal case
You covered up
Did you come to be
Be yourself

Not yourself

Know yourself

Cuz no one
Seems to know you now

We carry what we can't control

Approaching original violence

In the silence

There is a nihilist

Who does't care
And now they're dead

To each his own

I can do with one less
Watered down excuse

There comes a time
When we can't
Take the same abuse

If this is over
You can tell me it's no use

Use

Drug out bits
I'll never get to say
What you wanted doesn't matter
Nothing's gonna change
I don't wanna watch
Another brother f**king die
So discarded  fall over the side

Don't tell me it's the only way
Just another reason
Why you never take the bait
The trials  the screaming
The burdens of the beast
F**ked your face
And turned your back on
Everything you thought
Could save a try

We are the angels fear to tread

Approaching original violence

We're the silence

We'll deny it

We can't continue on like this

To each his own
I can do with one less
Watered down excuse

There comes a time
When we can't
Take the same abuse

My God
It won't take it just one
Reckless day from you

Now that this is over you can
Tell me it's no use

Now that this is over you can
Tell me it's no use

Use
Just tell me it's over

It doesn't matter what you say

It doesn't matter what you do

We can't continue on like thisI'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to eliminate for everyone the everyday abusive things that you have done
Your impossible ego,****
It's like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
And if you touch me I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that ***** you call a heart
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I'm turning it around
Like a knife in the shell
I wanna understand why
But I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lot of reasons to stop it
I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard but at least I admit it
At least I admit it
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
I know you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague yourself作曲 : Edsel Dope/Tripp Eisen

DieThere was no way
No light inside
No one to hear
The final fight
An epic thunder
Over the town
The earth was shaking
When you lost your crown
Where was my mind when there was time
A beast just threat me over the line
Give me your body
Give me your soul
Enjoy your descent
You lost control
Give me your body
Give me your soul
Enjoy your descent
You lost control
Don't you want to see this part of me
I shake your hand but I disagree
You need the money - I need your life
Your blood runs like honey from my knife
The delicious flavor of all these lies
A little favor to the blinded mice
Give me your body
Give me your soul
Enjoy your descent
You lost control
Give me your body
Give me your soul
Enjoy your descent
You lost control
Where was my mind when there was time
A beast just threat me over the line
There was no way, no light inside
No one to hear the final fight
Give me your body
Give me your soul
Enjoy your descent
You lost control
Give me your body
Give me your soul
Enjoy your descent
You lost controlThis is the year where hope fails you
The test subjects run the experiment
And the bastards you know is the hero you hate
But cohesion is possible if we try
There's no reason, there's no lesson, no time like the present
Tell me right now, what have you got to lose?
What have you got to lose, except your soul?
Who's with us?!
(I fight) for the unconventional
(My right) and its unconditional
(I can only) be as real as I can
The disadvantage is I never knew the plan
(This isn't) just a way to be a martyr
(I can't) walk alone any longer
(I fight) for the ones who can't fight
And if I lose, at least I tried!
(We) We are the new diabolic
(We) We are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) We are the pulse of the maggots
(I won't) be the inconsequential
(I won't) be the wasted potential
I can make it as severe as I can
Until you realize you'll never take a stand
(It isn't) just a one-sided version
(We've dealt) with a manic subversion
(I won't) let the truth be perverted
And I won't leave another victim deserted
(We) We are the new diabolic
(We) We are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) We are the pulse of the maggots
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
(We fight) 'til no one can fight us
(We live) and no one can stop us
(We pull) when we're pushed to far
And the advantage is, the bottom line is
(We never) had to fight in the first place
(We only) had to spit back in their face
(We won't) walk alone any longer
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger
(We) We are the new diabolic
(We) We are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) We are the pulse of the maggots
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)Before I forget

Go!
Stapled shut, inside and ouside would and I′m
Sealed in tight, but some irradical
Construed through pick, closing in and I′m
Catostrophic, not again
Expand quite the pain, and douse in gasoline
I′m wicked like a stain, yeah I′m the one who′s insane
It gets me up, I know your sorted little insurrections
I′ve got no time to lose, and I′m just caught up in all the cattle
Frey the stings
Through the sheathes
Hold your breath
And listen!
I am a worm before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget

I am a worm before I am a man

I′m ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt and I′m
Wiggled like a stitch, yet I′m the one who′s hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscrestions
I′ve got no right to way, I′m just caught up all the battles
Locked in flesh
Pushed in place

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OH!Kreuzigung
Er trägt ein schweres Kreuz
Und die Last der Menschheit
Eine Dornenkrone
Und nähert sich seiner Freiheit
Für ihn wird es kein Erbarmen geben
Nur Blut,Schweiß und Tränen
Und so nimmt es seinen Lauf
Und er schaut zum Himmel auf
"Vater,vergib ihnen"
Und man schlägt die Nägel ein
"Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun"
Und immer leiser wird sein Schrein
Die Sonne treibt sein Schweiß
Er friert,doch ist ihm heiss
langsam schlägt sein Herz
Es mildert seinen Schmerz
Außer ihm,alles lacht
Bevor er fällt in die Ohnmacht
Er ist zum Tod verdammt
Man ihm ein Speer in die Brust rammt
"Vater,vergib ihnen"
Und man schlägt die Nägel ein
"Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun"
Und immer leiser wird sein Schrein
"Vater,vergib ihnen"
Und man schlägt die Nägel ein
"Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun"
Und immer leiser wird sein SchreinMy declaration hurts, just wanna stab it right now
Congratulations, you've found yourself
Been preaching too many times to an hysterical mind
So won't you ****in' behave yourself
It's all in there, without despair
So you've saved your soul
It always depends who will deliver
Have you ever known
Such a beautiful mind that gives you shelter?
I'm waitin' for something to show
I might as well
Just drag me down so low
I'm down the drain and I've got nothing to fear
With a polluted mind
I had my share of losin'
Don't you ever cross that line?
So you've saved your soul?
It always depends who will deliver
Have you ever known
Such a beautiful mind that gives you shelter?
Break the record, in a second
Cherish your mental weapons
Watch the progress from an aspect
That's stabbing the drama inside
I'm waiting for something to show
I might as well
Just drag me down so low
I'm waiting for something to show
My punishment
For being down so low
I can't believe how it used to be
Selfish minds were abusin' me
Self pity and determined to crawl
Manipulation of a merciful, soul
I'm waiting for something to show
I might as well
Just drag me down so low
I'm waiting for something to show
My punishment
For being down so lowThe fires burn on the summit
Shining a light on the ones I*ve killed
Survivor*s guilt, I*m determined
I can murder the world in all the blood I*ve spilled
WE*RE DISMISSED
TO HELL WITH YOUR INTELLIGENCE
JUST FIGURE OUT YOUR COMMON SENSE
NO ONE IS BULLETPROOF
I*ll eat the skins of my brothers
Their upholstered bones will make a perfect wall
Can I fill in the cracks with these feelings?
With every day
OR MAYBE NOTHING AT ALL
SELFISHNESS
TAKE CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING
WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR
IT DOESN*T MATTER ANYMORE
NO ONE IS BULLETPROOF
CAN YOU FEEL THE COLD?
FORTUNE NEVER FAVORS THE OLD
TIRED OF DEFENDING MYSELF
GO COMPLAIN TO SOMEBODY ELSE
SOMEBODY ELSE
YEAH
All the voices in your head
They*re smashing at your windows
And you hide beneath the bed
You live like ...
So you*ll die like begging gods
In between the voices of the pure
NINE FOR SURE
It*s avoiding shit that I don*t need
Feel free to make your delegation
I can*t believe I*m saying this
I*ll die by my decisions
I*m not your ****ing superstar
NO ONE IS BULLETPROOF
BULLETPROOF
NO ONE IS BULLETPROOF
BULLETPROOFUndo these chains, my friend

I'll show you the rage I've hidden

Perish the Sacrament

Swallow, but nothing's forgiven

You and I can't decide

which of us was taken for granted

Make amends,

some of us are destined to be outlived

Step inside, see the Devil in I

Too many times,
we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I

You'll realise
I'm not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men

Something is tempting the father

Where is your will, my friend?

Insatiates never even bother

You and I, wrong or right

Traded a lie for the leverage

In between the lens in light

You're not what you seem

Step inside, see the Devil in I

Too many times,
we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I

You'll realize I'm not your Devil

I'm not your Devil anymore

Your station
Is abandoned
Fool you 'cause I know
what you've done
Sensation
Depravation
You should've burned
when you turned on everyone

Step inside, see the Devil in I

Too many times,
we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I

I know you'll find your answers

Do we get a little taste as unique
The libertine

Know what I mean

Hiroshima on a sad day

You had a gift

You were a gift

But there's always a goddamn catch

Blessing and a curse
You made it work

The universe is so much smaller

Dear friend
Why

Why do the limits have to reunite

Hero
Martyr
Mystery
God

He was the best of us

The world will never see
Another crazy motherf**ker like you

The world will never know
Another man as amazing as you

(Oh)

Never be the same

I want the blame
To be assigned to the guiltiest one

It can't be done

Because it's on

Consider me arrested

I'm so f**king pissed
At all of this
You gotta know
That you are sorely missed
Miracles are real
They help you heal

They make you feel

Like things will get better
Father
Brother

Why did we only skip this time

Stop taking the best of us

I won't let you disappear

I will keep your soul alive

If I can't have you here

History may have it's share
Of lunatics and stars

But the world will never see

Where am I supposed to begin

I'm killing for the karma again

Feed the meter in the machine

But living is the way to be saved

God  are we alone

God  are we alone

God  are we alone

God  we're not alone

I can't let you disappear

I will keep your soul alive

If I can't have you here

We were meant to be the kings

Rule the masses  run the risk

And keep our systems clean

History may have it's share

Of lunatics and stars

Dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da-da-da
Dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da-da-da!
(Yeah)
(Right)
Half alive and stark raving free in the line front
Croaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised
It's strange, whenever I see a gun
I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my ****ing mind!
Yeah, it blows my ****ing mind!
These days, I never seem to get enough
I’m tired of this shit, I want to go up
Don't waste my ****ing time!
Don't waste my ****ing time!
Because anything exceptional
Gets crushed by governed people
With jealousy and ignorance
And all that coven equals
This one, it isn't special
Collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment
I know it’s on my way
(Cut- cut- cut me up and
****- ****- **** me up)
Cut- cut- cut me up and
****- ****- **** me up!
Irreverence is my disease
It's secondhand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity
Somewhere on a toilet wall
I read the words you form along
To form a life, they're for my life
And I find myself a truth
Something so profound and now it's sitting there
Surrounded by the damage of the state
Another victim of the refuse
Now I've been saying this for years
But you don't comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear
Because I understand it
Androgeny and insults
Your choice, don't wanna be difficult
You want to win the war?
Know what you're fighting for
(Cut- cut- cut me up and
****- ****- **** me up)
Cut- cut- cut me up and
****- ****- **** me up!
Cut- (cut) cut- (cut) cut me up and
****- (****) ****- (****) **** me up!
Irreverence is my disease
It's secondhand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity
With angel eyes and demon seeds
You're missing what you really need
When all is said and done, you see
The last man standing gets no pity
(No pity)
(Cut- cut- cut me up and
****- ****- **** me up)
Cut- (cut) cut- (cut) cut me up and
****- (****) ****- (****) **** me up!
Cut- cut- cut me up and
****- ****- **** me up!A Little Piece Of Heaven-Avenged...
Before the story begins, is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine, until the end of time
We were more than friends, before the story ends
And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true, I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears, conjuring her deepest fears
(Come here you fxxking *****)
Must have stabbed her fifty fxxking times, I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes, eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it
She was never this good in bed, even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fxxking deep in
It goes on and on and on
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
Let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I'd mi**ehaved
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fxxking times, I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes, eyes over easy
Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah yeah
I will suffer for so long (What will you do, not long enough)
To make it up to you (I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do (Well then I'll break you unchained)
And if it's not enough (If it's not enough, it's not enough)
If it's not enough (Not enough)
Try again (Try again)
And again (And again)
Over and over again
We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing
(Do you take this man in death for the rest of your natural life, yes I do
Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your natural life, I do
I now pronounce you...)Some shitty people told me
I'm
I'm against the lie
And I am so cool
Some shitty people told me
I'm
I'm against the lie
And I am so kind
But I tell you
My life includes so much lies
And I am so bad
But I tell you
My life includes so much lies
And I'm just a shit!

Somebody Put Something In My Drink

Somebody

Another night out on the street
Stopping for my usual seat

Oh, bartender, please

tonic's my favorite drink

I don't like anything colored pink

That just stinks...it's not for me

It feels like somebody put something

Somebody put something in my drink

Somebody put something

Somebody put something

Blurred vision and dirty thoughts

Feel out of place, very distraught
Feel something coming on

Kick the jukebox, slam the floor
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more

I can't think

Hey! What's in this drink?

It feels like somebody put something

Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink

Somebody put something

Somebody put something in my drink

Somebody put something...

in my drink...
in my drink...

in my drink...

in my drink

So you think it's funny
A college prank
Goin' insane for something to drink

Feel a little dry

Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me
Cause somebody put something in my drink

I can't think

Hey! Give me a drink

It feels like somebody put something

Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something

Somebody put something in my drink...作词 : Johnson, Young, Young

  soon i discovered that this rock thing was true
 jerry lee lewis was the devil
 jesus was an architect previous to his career as a prophet
 all of a sudden, i found myself in love with the world
 so there was only one thing that i could do
 was ding a ding dang my dang a long ling long

Convulsing together.sing
Violently, move the jaw
Cry aloud. bound up the dead
Triumphantly
The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
You pray so hard on bloody knees.

The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
Down in the cool air I can see.
Hey, yeah - Im the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah - Im your superbeast

Hey, yeah - Im the one that you wanted

Stir the limbs across the wrist,
Full possession of memory.

Bury me as a dog,
Icy hands surrounding me.

I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud.
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another think comin'.

That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another think comin'.

In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.

Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best.
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.The final victory
We are writing the year 1543 AD, the time the black plaque struck
Agen, here Michael Nostradamus lived with his wife and two children.
He confidently began to treat his fellow citizens, but - unfortunately -
Was not able to save his family from his old enemy...
This was also a time the holy cross was rising with unstoppable might
Again, a trace of tears and blood covered the land
The final victory
Has crushed the autumn silence
The final victory
Has crushed the autumn silence
The final victory

So God has found him weeping
And wrath flickered deep withing His eyes
"So thy shalt suffer “
As long ago the one's been crucified"
The keeper of the Lord's mark
Is rising up with this ability
Heavenly damnation

Death in all the centuries is what I left behind

Forgotten in the promised land
Death in all the centuries is what I left behind
The knowledge, brought to the world
Is growing with a bitter taste
In a dream I saw things that will be
Centuries away

So feed the spark
Welcome to the land of dark
Death in all the centuries is what I left behind
Take my hand
Forgotten in the promised land
Death in all the centuries is what I left behind
The night when evil steps out of the dark
And the cross is rising again
And fires are keeping the light
Burn, my friend...
And the sign of humanity is burning tonight
I can't escape from this ritual silence
Humanity's burning tonight
When I open my eyes
I see soldiers in the fields
Dead bodies on the ground
There are children inbetween
Explosions shock the land
And the evil shows its face
The one called Hister rises
This is the fall of grace...
Beast ferocious from hunger will swim across rivers
The greater part of the region will be against the Hister
The great one will cause it to be dragged in an iron cage
When the German child will obcserve nothing

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know how your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done

Peace suffocates their freedom
This'll better me  a part of me
You were a par and a nag
Thinkin' that you lost  my friend
It doesn't matter what price  you win
Blood  sweat  and bastard-size
Stare into the killer in your eyes
Besiege me  I kiss your cancer

Deceiving  this doesn't matter

dear heart Once apart,
she can touch nor me nor you
Dressed as one
A wolf will betray a lamb
Lead astray the gazers
The razors on your seducing skin
In the meadow of sinful thoughts
Every flower`s perfect
To paradise with pleasure haunted by fear
A sin for him
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
I am the Fallen
You are what my sins enclose
Lust is not as creative
As its discovery
To paradise with pleasure haunted by fear
A sin for him...
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
Bless me,undress me
Pick your prey in a wicked way
God I must confess...
I do envy the sinners
A sin for him...
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
A sin for him
Desire within
Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sinFire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I'm gonna burn so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind cause you're never gonna give in
It's a crisis, just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

The Lord of lies

The morning star

You had to be set free

Opposing sides

Your choices are

The negative one and me

Svengali; Why are we the enemies?
I never follow but I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna getcha
Because your walls can't support each other
Settle for the cynical, you're so political
You're getting ready cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?

The Lord of lies

The morning star

You had to be set free

Opposing sides

Your choices are

The negative one and me

The negative one and me

I hope you live to see the day

When you're world goes up in flames

And as you die you see my face

You're the only one to blame

The prescient; The nascent
The quotient

The cystic symbolic condition

Egregious, replete with these lesions

Succumb to the selfish creation

No accountability, divisibility
I point a finger but it's always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The colour fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away, the killer is disavowed!

Wir waren namenlos
Und ohne Lieder
Recht wortlos
Waren wir nie wieder
Etwas sanglos
Sind wir immer noch
Dafuer nicht klanglos
Man hoert uns doch
Nach einem Windstoss
Ging ein Sturm los
Einfach beispiellos
Es wurde Zeit
Los  【双关：zeitlos】
Sie waren sprachlos
So sehr schockiert
Und sehr ratlos
Was war passiert
Etwas fassungslos
Und garantiert
Verstaendnislos
Das wird zensiert
Sie sagten grundlos
Schade um die Noten
So schamlos
Das gehoert verboten
Es ist geistlos
Was sie da probieren
So geschmacklos
Wie sie musizieren
Ist es hoffnungslos
Sinnlos
Hilflos
Sie sind gott
Los  【双关：gottlos】
Wir waren namenlos
Wir haben einen Namen
Waren wortlos
Die Worte kamen
Etwas sanglos
Sind wir immer noch
Dafuer nicht klanglos
Das hoert man doch
Wir sind nicht fehlerlos
Nur etwas haltlos
Ihr werdet lautlos
Uns nie los
Wir waren namenlos

You're one of us!You want to hate me for the way you hate yourself
You think you can find who you are in someone else
Criticize who already found their positioning
You've got a long way to go
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
A needless ir repair repairing your despair
You take great measure to appear like you don't care
The decision and persuasion must deceive thee properly
You lost it before you began
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
Only yourself left to betray
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray

Hey  you,hey  you  devils  little  sister

Hold  it  between  your  legs  turn  it  up,turn  it  up

A  lone-ly  life  where  no  one  understands  you
But  don't  give  up  because  the  music  do

And  it  is  raging  inside  you,forever  preaching

Hey  you,hey  you  finally  you  get  it
The  world  ain't  fair,eat  you  if  you  let  it
And  as  your  tears  fall  on  your  breast,your  dress
Vibrations  coming  through  you're  in  a  mess
A  lone-ly  life  where  no  one  understands  you
But  don't  give  up  because  the  music  do

There′s always a catch there′s always a snatch

There goes my Valentine again
Soaked in Red for what she said
And Now she's gone!

Oh my god have I done it again,
there's a pulse and it's deafening
I cant help what I hear in my head,
It's the switch that I flip, they said,
Hand of Blood!
I don't wanna feel my heart is breaking,
Hand OF Blood!
I don't wana see my life is burning

I saw you look away,
is what you've seen to much to take or are you blind and seeing nothing.
（I saw you run）I saw you run away,
Is what I've done to much to take or are you scared of being nothing.

（I saw you run） I saw you run away,
Is what I've done to much to take or are you scared of being nothingI did my time, and I want out
so abusive,fate
It doesn't cut,
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Back at you, subversion
Pseudo-sacred with scared perversion
Go drill your gasses,
Go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth
With all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
undone, it has begun
I'm not the only one
And the rain will kill us all,
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see,
The preservation of the martyr in me
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Oh, there are cracks, in the road we lay
from where the devil fell
The secrets have gone mad!
This is nothing new,
But would we kill it all?
fate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes
And say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness,
But a message to bring
I think we're done
I'm not the only one!
And the rain will kill us all,
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see,
The preservation of the martyr in me
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

I tried to tell you first,
Your hurtful lies are given out,
Can't stop the killing idea,
If it's hunting season,
Is this what you want?,
I'm not the only one!

I hear the silent whispers,
Darkness still upon me,
All those empty words
from the buried heart
I don't know where fear ends
and where hate begins,
It's all the same to me,
Life is falling apart
Hand in hand...side by side
I walk with fate in the night
The red fluid of life is flowing right along my arms,
I feel the sweet blade diving deep inside,
This moment I've been waiting for so long a time,
when I know the last cut will be for my life
I've looked through the eyes of pain
and seen the smile of death
I've wandered in the shadows of my fears
The feathers of a white dove
were stained by darkened tears
The final tune is soon to be played
Hand in hand...side by side
I walk with death in the nightShe's sticking needles in her skin
I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot, to fantasy
But her peace of mind, can't stay inside the lines
It's so, confusing, the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark, that I can see
Will she ever find, one million of a kind
It's cold and lonely, but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world
No one hurts this pretty girl but her...
Oh, she's beautiful
A little better than a mind deserves
You are not inside
Please tell me she won't shy
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (she loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (she loves me)
She's drowning in herself again
My god what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do, but have my way
She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers, it doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head
Something tells me I'm the one who's kept
Oh, so volatile
A little better than a mind defiled
Oh I need the pain
Please tell me sh*t won't change
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (she loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (she loves me)
We were meant to be together
Now die and fu*king love me
We were meant to hurt each other
Now die and fuc*ing love me
Die and fuc*ing love me
Die and fuc*ing love me
Die and fuc*ing love meSome legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake, is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me, the kids are all wrong
The story’s all off.heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in,
The bruises on your thighs, like my fingerprints
And this is for tonight, the thoughts you said you felt,
I never meant for you to fix yourself.
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake, is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
I can't stop til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light,
My shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom, You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake, is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Remember me for centuries
We've been here forever
And here's the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake, is all it will take
We'll go down in history

Wont go to heaven
She's just another lost soul, about to be mine again
Leave her
We will recieve her
It is beyond your control
will you ever meet again.

Devon
No longer living
Who had been rendered unwhole.
As a little child,
she was taken
and then forsaken
you will remember it all
Let it blow your mind again.

Devon lies beyond this portal
take the word of one immortal
Give your soul to me
For eternity
release your life
to begin another time with her
End your grief with me
there's another way
release your life
take your place inside the fire with her

Severed
Now and forever
you're just another lost soul about to be mine again
see her, you'll never free her
you must surrender it all
And give life to me again

Fire
All you desire
As she begins to turn cold one final time
you will shiver
till you deliver
you will remember it all
Let it blow your mind again

You will see me sipping

If you're feeling like I feel
Throw your fist through the ceiling
Some people call it crazy
Well, I call it healing
If you need love, turn around
Do the helicopter
If you're sick, baby girl
I would love to be your doctor
So burn it down, burn it down
So burn it down, burn it down

Looking through a window made of time
Would you have the courage not to lie?
Looking down the barrel of today
Would that make you turn around and stay?
Looking through a window made of time
Would you have the courage not to lie?

Dragula!The child without a name
grew up to be the hand
To watch you' to shield you'
or kill on demand
The choice he made
he could not comprehend
He’s got a grim secret
they had to command

He’s torn between his honor
and the true love of his life
He prayed for both but was denied

So many dreams are broken
and so much we sacrifice
Was it worth the ones we loved
and had to leave behind
So many years have past
toward a noble land of lies
Will all our sins be justified?

The curse of his powers tormented his life
Obeying the crown was a sinister crime
His soul was tortured by love and by pain
He surely would flee but the oath made him stay

He’s torn between his honor
and the true love of his life
He prayed for both but was denied

So many dreams are broken
and so much we sacrifice
Was it worth the ones we loved
and had to leave behind
So many years have past
toward a noble land of lies
Will all our sins be justified?

Please forgive me for the sorrow
For leaving you in fear
For the dreams we had to silence
That’s all there’ll ever be
Still I’ll be the hand that saves you
Though you’ll not see that it is me

So many dreams are broken
and so much we sacrifice
Was it worth the ones we loved
and had to leave behind
So many years have past
toward a noble land of lies
Will all our sins be justified?作曲 : Dan Bălan

Bin ich schöner
zerschneid mir das Gesicht
bin ich stärker
brich feige mein Genick
bin ich klüger
töte mich und iss mein Hirn
Hab ich dein Weib
töte mich und iss mich ganz auf
dann iss mich ganz auf
Bin ich ehrlicher
beiss mir die Zunge ab
bin ich reicher
dann nimm mir alles
bin ich mutiger
töte mich und iss mein Herz
Hab ich dein Weib
töte mich und iss mich ganz auf
dann iss mich ganz auf
doch leck den Teller ab
Es kocht die Eifersucht

Hab ich die klaren Augen
nimm mir das Licht
Hab ich die reine Seele
töte sie in Flammen
Habe ich dein Weib dann
töte mich und iss mich ganz auf
dann iss mich ganz auf

EifersuchtBury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…
So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my Fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you…
My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight
So save your breath, I will not hear.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a Saint…
My own was banished long ago
It took the Death of Hope to let you go
So Break Yourself Against My Stones
And Spit Your Pity In My Soul
You Never Needed Any Help
You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself
And I Won't Listen To Your Shame
You Ran Away - You're All The Same
Angels Lie To Keep Control…
My Love Was Punished Long Ago
If You Still Care, Don't Ever Let Me Know
If you still care, don't ever let me know…作曲 : Caliban

We  are  one  voice –One  heart!
We  are  one  voice –One  heart!
You  sound  like  a  broken  record,
different  words  for  the  same  old  lies,
You  know  we ’ll  be  the  ones  who  suffer,
you  gain  power  while  we  pay  the  price.
Every  time  you  open  your  mouth,
you  spread  a  disease!
You  try  to  make  us  voiceless,
you  try  to  make  us  believe,（but …）
We  are  the  many,
like  drops  of  water,
Alone  we  are  nothing,
together  we ’re  crushing.
We  are  the  many,
like  a  plague  of  locusts,
Alone  we  are  nothing,

Alone  we  are  nothing,

We  are  one  voice –One  heart!
Any  disaster  is  very  welcome –
in  the  darkest  days  you  promise  the  sun.
Like  the  savior  of  a  world  in  debris?

Maze psychopathic daze I create this waste
Back away from tangents
On the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place
I deny my face
Sweat gets in my eyes
Lash out at all I despise

Hands on my face over bearing
I can't get out

Hands on my face over bearing
I can't get out
Lost  ran at my own cost

Hearing noises  scoffed
Searching from the rush
Detached from such and such
Bleak  standing on my feet
Listening incomplete
I am not a dog
But I'm the one you dog

Hands on my face over bearing
I can't get out

Hands on my face over bearing
I can't get out
Never ever serrated  I won't allow it
Never ever serrated  I won't allow it
Never ever serrated  I won't allow it

Despise  despise

Cut me  show me
Enter I am
Willing and able
And never any danger to myself

Knowledge in my pain
Knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase
Empathy out of my way
I can't die

I can't die

I can't die

I can't die

Never ever serrated  I won't allow it

Even now, I realize the time I’ll never get.
Another story of the Bitter Pills of Fate.
I can’t go back again.
I can’t go back again…
But you asked me to love you and I did.
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit.
And when I got away, I only got so far.
The Other Me Is Dead.
I hear his voice inside my head…
But I’ll never survive with Dead Memories in my heart.
You told me to love you and I did.
Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit.
So when I got away, I only kept my scars.
The Other Me Is Gone.
Now I don’t know where I belong…
But I’ll never survive with Dead Memories in my heart.
Dead Visions in your Name.
Dead Fingers in my Veins.
Dead Memories in my Heart…The bogeyman is waiting
In the shadows of your dreams
You're afraid to fall asleep
You're awake 'til you're too weak
Come sweetie come it's bogey time,
let me in and you'll be mine
This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You'll never know (know)
This pain
That's accusing you
My scars don't even begin to show
This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You'll never know (know)
This pain
That's accusing you
My scars don't even begin to show
Your soul is broken
And can never be mend (never be mend)
You are trapped in a silent cage
Come sweetie, come
Come sweetie come it's bogey time,
Let me in and you'll be mine
Run sweetie run, cry and fade,
This will be your last serenade
Run, cry, fight, die
This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You'll never know (know)
This pain
That's accusing you
My scars don't even begin to show
This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You'll never know (know)
This pain
That's accusing you
My scars don't even begin to show (begin to show)
Here comes the bogeyman (bogeyman)
Here comes the bogeyman (bogeyman)
Penetrates your dreams
Here comes the bogeyman (bogeyman)
Taking white
Giving redUndo these chains, my friend
I’ll show you the rage I’ve hidden
Swallow, but nothing’s forgiven
You and I can’t decide
which of us was taken for granted
Make amends
some of us are destined to be outlived
Step inside
See The Devil In I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
Step inside
See The Devil In I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil anymore
Under the words of men
something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend
Insatiates never even bother
You and I
wrong or right
traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light
you’re not what you seem
Step inside
See The Devil In I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
Step inside
See The Devil In I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil
I’m Not Your Devil Anymore
Your Station- Is Abandoned-
Fool You ‘cause I know what you’ve done
Sensation- Deprivation-
You should’ve burned when you turned on everyone
So Step inside
See The Devil In I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
Step inside
See The Devil In I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside
See The Devil In I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil… anymore
Step inside
 See The Devil In ITrapped in purgatory
A lifeless object alive
A waiting reprisal
Death will be their acquisition
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many now ornaments dripping above
A waiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away

Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now I shall reign in blood!作词 : Slipknot

Everybody hates me now, so f**k it
Blood's on my face and my hands, and I don't know why
I'm not afraid to cry, but thats none of your business

Keine Schmerzen, kein Gesicht
Nur noch Stille, dunkles Licht
Nun ergibt dies für mich Sinn
Endlich weis ich wo ich bin
Und so blicke ich zurück auf jene Menschen die ich damals kannt
auf jene mit denen ich durch das Leben streifte Hand in Hand
Zu sehen das ich die Welt verändert' als ich eins ins Jenseits stieg
Zeit das ich mein Leben lebte und dies allein macht mich Antik
Den Sinn in meinem Leben habe ich mir selbst gegeben
und das bedeutet Krieg
Dies macht mich Antik
Hab es genossen Stück um Stück
blicke gern zur Lebzeit zurück
und das bedeutet Sieg
dies macht mich Antik
Menschen die mich einst verließen oder die mich damals hassten
Es mir schwerer machten, sich mit meinem Leben nie befassten
Auch wenn sie es mir nicht glauben wollen ich bedanke mich
denn nur durch ihren Hass und neid bin ich jetzt unsterblic
Menschen lieben dich wenn du deine Sache hast gut gemacht
Doch machst du deine Sache richtig bist du gottlos und verhasst
Der Tod ist der zeitlose Frieden und das leben ist der Krieg
Nur wenn du diese Schlacht gewinnst bist auch du Antik
Den Sinn in meinem Leben habe ich mir selbst gegeben
und das bedeutet Krieg
Dies macht mich Antik
Hab es genossen Stück um Stück, blicke gern zur Lebzeit zurück
und das bedeutet Sieg
dies macht mich Antik
Menschen die mich einst verließen oder die mich damals hassten
Es mir schwerer machten, sich mit meinem Leben nie befassten
Auch wenn sie es mir nicht glauben wollen ich bedanke mich
denn nur durch ihren Hass und neid ... bin ich jetzt antik
und das bedeutet sieg
dies macht mich antik"Harken, o'kinsmen what I have to tell
The marsh realm is suffering from sinister spell
Come gather around the ember so bright
And listen to what has happened that night
Unknown paths to areas unseen
Surrounded by twilight, at heart kind of keen
Through tendrils like claws I made my way
Deities besides me tempting to stray
As I roamed through these woods of old
I felt there was something grim to unfold..."

Forlorn mortal now listen to my vow
An oath I swear as thy oldest foe
Just before the next full moon rise
We'll celebrate thy tribe's demise
For too long we've avoided a war
But now we'll start it with barbaric roar
Fear the fall of the forthcoming night
Its end will be thy end alike!

O' powerful seer grant me thy charm
The rage of a bear that no one could harm
Ancient idols awake! For I offer thee blood
Mortal lives I will take and drown them in mud!
With the sunset at the edge of the heel-stone
Let us summon by the marshland border
For the war god's watching from his wood-throne
Thus we will obey this final order

Horror is mine... Bones I grind
The skull of thine... They won't find
In my lair... My hidden cave
Thy despair! My home - thy grave!
Blood gush I source - Bloodshed I force

"The only reason they left me alive
Is to announce that (at last) no one will survive
Beware of the shapes that in twilight creep
Grim omens that tell us we're (already) in too deep..."作曲 : John 5

Nothing suffocates you more than
The passing of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask you make
your children breath in to survive
Well I′m not a slave to a god
that doesn′t exist
And I′m not a slave to a world
that doesn′t give a shit
And when we were good
you just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
we′ll scar your minds
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
You′ll never grow up to be a big rock star
celebrated victim of your fame
They′ll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
dnd say that death was on sale today
And when we were good
you just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
we′ll scar your minds
Well I′m not a slave to a god
that doesn′t exist
And I′m not a slave to a world
that doesn′t give a shit
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
But the death of millions is just a statistic
Well I′m not a slave to a god
that doesn′t exist
And I′m not a slave to a world
that doesn′t give a shit
Well I′m not a slave to a god
that doesn′t exist

Ein kleiner Mensch stirbt nur zum Schein
wollte ganz alleine sein
das kleine Herz stand still fur Stunden
so hat man es fur tot befunden
es wird verscharrt in nassem Sand
mit einer Spieluhr in der Hand
Der erste Schnee das Grab bedeckt
hat ganz sanft das Kind geweckt
in einer kalten Winternacht
ist das kleine Herz erwacht

Als der Frost ins Kind geflogen
hat es die Spieluhr aufgezogen
eine Melodie im Wind
und aus der Erde singt das Kind
Hoppe hoppe Reiter
und kein Engel steigt herab
mein Herz schlagt nicht mehr weiter
nur der Regen weint am Grab

und aus der Erde singt das Kind
Der kalte Mond in voller Pracht

Zwischen harten Eichendielen

I only wanna believe in ******' anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything

THE ENDING'S THE SAME
THE WORLD WILL NOT CHANGE
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR…

Tell your Mothers they have no Sons or Daughters
Blame yourselves because your Children are Mine
We are Orphans, but we are not Forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in ******' everything
But we're alive and we're not accepting anything

THE ENDING'S THE SAME
THE WORLD WILL NOT CHANGE
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR… ANNIHILATION

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
They gave to me now I give to you

Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER MORE

WE HAVE TO SAVE OURSELVES

I will never become another piece
Inside the Paralytic Construct I hate
Live Forever? Well, I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in f*uckin' anything
But my solace is I CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING

THE ENDING'S THE SAME

Crazy,but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes,
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love
And forget how to hate
Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I've listened to preachers
I've listened to fools,
I've went to the dropouts,
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words
Yeah-h
Heirs of a cold war
That's what we've become
Inheriting troubles
I'm mentally dumb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something and its just not fair
Mental wounds not healing
Probably in pain
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy trainI Love Your Skin Oh So White

And I Love Every Single Tear You Cry

You're Gone With The Sin, My Baby, And Beautiful You Are

I Just Love The Way You're Running Out Of Life

You're Gone With The Sin, My Baby, And Beautiful You Are
So Gone With The Sin, My DarlingDon't question any lies, 
There's no reason to find, 
Another trip, to cause a denial. 
Yet you're stripped and your hope is gone. 
Another trap, for you to fall into, 
You swallow every threat that enter to your mind. 
Enter your mind. 
A shadow just as dark as your past, is leading your way through a web of desire. 
Healing all the wounds in your chest, ...vengeance is rising. 
Can I ever resolve, 
If it's a matter of do or die? 
Can I ever resolve, if it's a matter of time? 
Just remember, 
Where you've spent your time. 
Can't respect all the tears you have cried. 
Just remember, 
How you've changed your life. 
Can't change your fate with a pitiful cry. 
Pitiful cry. 
Don't question any lies, 
There's no reason to find, 
Another trip, to cause a denial. 
Yet you're stripped and your hope is gone. 
Another trap, for you to fall into 
Can I ever resolve, 
If it's a matter of do or die? 
Can I ever resolve, if it's a matter of time? 
Just remember, 
Where you've spent your time. 
Can't respect all the tears you have cried. 
Just remember, 
How you've changed your life. 
Can't change your fate with a pitiful cry. 
There's no way you can dig much deeper, 
If you think it's alright. 
Assorting the right from the wrong ones, 
That you have learned so well.. 
You're stuck you can't remember, 
The light is turning dim, 
You're trapped although you've been there, 
A thousand times before. (x2) 
Crestfallen be thy name. (x2)Lack of motivation? 
At every occasion 
Tell me, did you earn your name? 
So why did you reckon it would bring you fame? 
Lack of understanding? 
It's kind of demanding 
So then, did you earn your respect? 
I'd rather say you suffer from a defect 
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity 
For now, it will at least bring humility 
For all what it's worth - past glory 
I bring no comfort 
Lack of dedication? 
That's why 
I'm on medication 
Well, how did you ever earn your integrity? 
You're nothing but a failure in eternity 
Lack of measures? 
I never found any treasures 
Now, how did you get your crown? 
For me it'll represent the lake in which you'll drown 
Condemn the free mind, salute conformity 
For now, at least it will bring humility 
For all it's worth - final cut 
I will keep my mouth shutKill The Sun

I am down at the water
My bare feet are numb
And for aeons now nothing seems real

now it''s hard to hold sight
Through your soft eiderdown
But I still got my hands on the wheel

You can rain down on me
but you can''t darken the sun
You can cast a spell on the moon
but you can''t kill the sun

You have set my mind
Between worlds spinning round
i''m a stranger in my universe

But I see my sun
And I know that it will
Be forever shining on earth

You can rain down on me

People like you;
you live in a dream world 
You despise the outside and you fear the next one 

It’s in your dream 
There’s just one question
Should I kill or should I be left behind? 
Sick and tired of all your complaints 
This is the hour, we bring it down 
I’ve come to realize 
With every little glimpse you fade 
I was told that I could fly 
When least expected - cloud connected 

You seem to be so introverted 
How come we fail with all that is given 

You crossed the line 
You remember my name 
Time runs backwards 
As long as you are heading that way  
I’ve come to realize 
With every little glimpse you fade 
I was told that I could fly 
When least expected - cloud connected 

I’ve come to realize

Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Forever and ever
Indoctrinated minds so very often
Contain sick thoughts
And commit most of the evil they preach against
Don’t try to convince me with messengers from God
You accuse us of sins committed by yourselves
It’s easy to condemn without looking in the mirror
Behind the scenes opens reality
Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale
Nor is the will to forget
Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Virginity has been stolen at very young ages
And the extinguisher loses its immunity
Morbid abuse of power in the garden of eden
Where the apple gets a youthful face
Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale
Nor is the will to forget
Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Forever and ever
Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale
Nor is the will to forget
You can’t go on hiding yourself
Behind old fashioned fairytales
And keep washing your hands in innocence无歌词I push my fingers into my eyes...
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache...
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache...
But it's made of all the things I have to take...
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...
If the pain goes on...
Aaaaaaaah!

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now, All I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact:
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!

Put me back together
Or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the Pieces, then you can leave me
alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way,
Nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got...all I've got is insane...
All I've got...all I've got is insane...
All I've got...all I've got is insane!
All I've got...all I've got is insane!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!作曲 : Trent Reznor

You're keeping in step,
And in line.
Got your chin held high,
And and you feel just fine.
Cause you do,
What you're told.
But inside your heart,
It is black,
And it's hollow,
And it's cold.

Just how deep do you believe,
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds,
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?

What if this whole crusade's
A charade.
And behind it all,
There's a price to be paid.
For the blood,
Which we dine.
Justified in the name,
Of the Holy and the Divine.

Just how deep do you believe,
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew untill it bleeds,
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see,
Do you wanna change it?

So naive,
I keep holding what I wanna believe.
I can see,
But I keep holding on,
And on,
And on,
And on.

Will you bite the hand that feeds you,
Will you stay down on your kneesWe are the things and shapes to come

Finally the hills are without eyes
They are tired of painting a dead
Man's face red With their own blood
They used to love having so much to lose
Blink your eyes just once
And see everything in ruins

Did you ever hear what I told you
Did you ever read what I wrote you
Did you ever listen to what we played
Did you ever let in what the world said
Did we get this far just to feel your hate
Did we play to become only pawns in the game
How blind can you be, don't you see
You chose the long road but we'll be waiting
Bye bye beautiful
Bye bye beautiful

Jacob's ghost for the girl in white
Blindfold for the blind
Dead siblings walking the dying earth
Noose around a choking heart
Eternity torn apart
Slow toll now the funeral bells
I need to die to feel alive
Did you ever hear what I told you
Did you ever read what I wrote you
Did you ever listen to what we played
Did you ever let in what the world said
Did we get this far just to feel your hate

It's not the tree that forsakes the flower
But the flower that forsakes the tree
Someday I'll learn to love these scars
Still fresh from the red-hot blade of your words

How blind can you be, don't you see
How blind can you be, don't you see
How blind can you be, don't you see

Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...

GOODBYE!I wipe it off on tile,

Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold,
the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I CAN'T CONTROL MY SHAKES!
How the hell did I get here?
Something about this,
Something wrong...
I have to laugh out loud,
I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?
I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...
GET OUTTA MY HEAD CUZ
I DON'T NEED THIS!
Why didn't I see this?
I'm a victim -
Manchurian Candidate
I - HAVE - SINNED - BY
- JUST Makin' my mind up
and takin' your breath away
I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell,
I wait and bleed...
I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell,
I wait and bleed...
GOODBYE!
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free
I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell,
I wait and bleed...
I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell,

AND IT WAITS FOR YOU!!!Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us
Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus!
In my darkest hours I could not foresee
That the tide could turn so fast to this degree
Can't believe my eyes
How can you be so blind?
Is the heart of stone, no empathy inside?
Time keeps on slipping away and we haven't learned
So in the end now what have we gained?
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,
can we break free from chains of never-ending agony?
Are they themselves to blame, the misery, the pain?
Didn't we let go, allowed it, let it grow?
If we can't restrain the beast which dwells inside
it will find it's way somehow, somewhere in time
Will we remember all of the suffering
Cause if we fail it will be in vain
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,
can we break free from chains of never-ending agony?


Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour

WHY DO THEY ALWAYS SEND THE POOR!
My god is of spiteful blood with morbid eels.
Victorious, victorious, steel,
Can you stand and kneel?
Marching forward hypocritic
and hypnotic computers.
You depend on our protection,
Yet you feed us lies from the table cloth.
la la la la la la la la la,
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time.
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine.

kneeling roses disappearing,
into Moses’ dry mouth,
breaking into Fort Knox,
stealing our intentions,
every city gripped in oil,
Crying FREEDOM!

Handed to absolution,
Still you feed us lies from the table cloth.
La la la la la la la la la,
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time.
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine.
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time.
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine.

Blast off, its Party time,
And we all live in a fascist nation,
Blast off , its party time,
And where the **** are you?
Where the **** are you?
Where the **** are you?
Why don’t presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don’t presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?

Kneeling roses disappearing,
into Moses’ dry mouth,
breaking into Fort Knox,
stealing our intentions,
every city gripped in oil,
Crying FREEDOM!
Handed to absolution,
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth.
la la la la la la la la la,
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time.
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine.
Everybody’s going to the party have a real good time.
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine.

Let's go!
Everybody needs to start their own fire
Everybody needs a riot of their own
Everybody needs to be something that they are not
Everybody needs to go it alone
Because!
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see
Okay!
All the time spent hanging on to anything
All the time spent knowing that they're wrong
All the time wasted' stolen back' innocent
You won't get a second more so move it along
Because!
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see
Wishing and hoping and thinking it's you
That's got this all under control
Never a minute has passed you all by
When they haven't invaded your soul
It's not something you can hold
It's not something you own
It's not something you can buy or steal
You've got it when you're alone
Being free is a tragedy
When you don't know yourself
Being free is a tragedy
When you don't know who you are
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see
Let's go!

Dead as dead can be
The doctor tells me
But I just can’t believe him
Ever the optimistic one
I’m sure of your ability
To become my perfect enemy
Wake up and face me
Don’t play dead cause maybe
Someday I will walk away and say
You disappoint me
Maybe you’re better off this way
Leanin' over you here
Cold and catatonic
I catch a brief reflection
Of what you could and might have been
It's your right and your ability
To become my perfect enemy
Wake up and face me
Don’t play dead cause maybe
Someday I will walk away and say
You disappoint me
Maybe you’re better off this way
Maybe you’re better off this way
Maybe you’re better off this way
Maybe you’re better off this way
You’re better of this…you’re better off this…
You’re better of this…you’re better off this…
Maybe you’re better off!
Wake up and face me
Don’t play dead cause maybe
Someday I will walk away and say
You ****in' disappoint me
Maybe you’re better off this way
Go ahead and play dead
I know that you can hear this
Go ahead and play dead
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me?

Nothing suffocates you more than the passing of everyday human events
Isolation is the oxygen mask you're making children breath into to survive

And I'm not a slave to world that doesn't give a shit

You'll never grow up to be a big rock star

And say that  death was on sale today
And when we were good
You just close your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds

And I'm not a slave to world that doesn't give a shit
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of a million is just a statistic

Michelle,lea  do  love  you  deep  in  heart.
My  disposition  is  in  a  possition  for  all  to  see.
Regretless  for  how  it  feels.
I  got  a  bullet  with  a  name  on  it.
Bullet  with  a  name.
Because  the  cause  for  all,the  pause  you  think  you  see
is  really  concentration  on  the  steel.
I  got  a  bullet  with  a  name  on  it.
Bullet  with  a  name.
See  everybody  watching  and  passing  judjement
on  every  little  move  and  disition  I  make.
How  can  i  be  an  individual  with  the  weight  of  the  world
with 8other  planets  to  take?
and  with  everything  happening
gunshots  clappin  and  people  all
runnin  in  every  direction
with  their  hands  up  prayin  for  the  drama  to  end,
I  got  my  hand  out  lookin  for  some  money  to  spend.

The  price  tags  on  the  things  i  need  are  getting  bigger  by  the  day
I  got  a  bullet  with  a  name  on  it.
Bullet  with  a  name.
The  way  I  work  so  hard  for  things  they  just  take  away  from  me.
I  got  a  bullet  with  a  name  on  it.
Bullet  with  a  name.
I'm  workin  harder  than  a  hundred  black  mules  down  in  Mexico.
No  water,no  clouds,no  cover,
from  the  hotter  than  Hell  no  dinner  bell,
empty  oven  again  from  another  bad  opinion.
I  mean  who  doesn't  want  the  cars,
money,fame,attention,bars,honeys,
games,attention,stars?
Funny  how  we  say  we  don't  need  it
then  turn  around  and  try  to  achieve  it.

Everything  that  they  say  about  me.
And  everything  that  they  make  me  need,
are  nothing  when  they're  taking  everything  away  from  me.
Everyone  trying  to  make  it  harder
and  everyone  saying  I  would  never  be.
You're  nothing  but  a  name  on  the  bullet  that  I  aim...作词 : Burton, Hammett, Hetfield ...
Life it seems' will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost' this cant be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filing me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn

People created religious inventions
To give their lives a glimmer of hope
And to ease their fear of dying
And people created religious intentions
Only to feel superior and to have a licence to kill
Our desire to die is stronger
Than all your desire for life

There is no getting away from it now

Only true faith survives

People created religious inventions

Than all your desire for life

Those people who lost their lives on of the 11th September
And those that mourn them.

Now is the time for the strength to that build community

Let that be their memorial
A disgrace on the beyond
O servitor, sempiterne
Te grati coluimus
Odor atrox quo nos superfundis intolerabilis est

Deceive yourself by yielding

To soft words that cause no pain

Enrich yourself with different views

Learned without disdain

A disgrace on the beyond

That can never be undone

Who shall rise and unveil

The Fa mang ade of reality?

Deceive yourself by yielding

To soft words that cause no pain

Enrich yourself with different views

Learned without disdain

Is there still room for new dents in old wrecks?
A disgrace on the beyond that can never be undone

Deceive yourself by yielding to soft words

Enrich yourself by making up your own mind

Dark bodies floating in darkness
No sign of light ever given
Imprisoned in a world without a memory
Unconscious or am i conscious?
Cut from the heart i am part of
Sometimes i feel as though i'm frozen in heaven
And i saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And i saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven
In dreams i see myself flying
Closer to the sun and i'm climbing
Tried to touch the sun
But the brightness burned my eyes
Unconscious or am i conscious?
Fell from the sky like a star
Sometimes i feel as though i'm frozen in heaven
And i saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And i saw my own face like a spark
Dark,dark,dark
My life was so dark,dark,dark
My mind was so dark,dark,dark
My life was so dark,dark,dark
Everything was dark
Unconscious or am i conscious?
Fell from the sky like a star
Sometimes i feel as though i'm frozen in heaven
And i saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And i saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven
Dark bodies floating in darkness

When You Stay Low
Nothing Happens
Does It Feel Right
Late At Night
Things I Thought I'd Put Behind Me
Haunt My Mind
I Just Know There's No Escape Now
Once It Sets It's Eyes On You
But I Wont Run
Have To Stare It In The Eyes
Stand My Ground
I Won't Give In
No More Denying
I've Gotta Face It
Won't Close My Eyes
And Hide The Truth Inside
If I Don't Make It Someone Else Will
Stand My Ground
It's All Around
Getting Stronger Coming Closer Into My World
I Can Feel That It's Time For Me To Face It
Can I Take It
Though This Might Just Be The Ending
Of The Life I Held So Dear
But I Won't Run
There's No Turning Back From Here
Stand My Ground
I Won't Give In
No More Denying
I've Gotta Face It
Won't Close My Eyes
And Hide The Truth Inside
If I Don't Make It Someone Else Will
Stand My Ground
All I Know For Sure Is That I'm Trying
I Will Always Stand My Ground
Stand My Ground
I Won't Give In （I Won't Give In）
I Won't Give Up （I Won't Give Up）
No More Denying （Ahh-hhhh）

Won't Close My Eyes And Hide The Truth Inside

A broken promise is as good as a lie.
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
and we will burn because we won't unite!
We won't witness anymore freedom.
Where is anybody? Do we need 'em?"
I would rather fight,
than let another die.
We're the problem,
but we're also the solution.
ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

If you want you cannot take it from me.
If you think you can, you still don't know me.
Let me tell you, when I said it, I meant it
and I will always have the right to defend it.
Fifty seconds, a hundred murders.
The bill of rights is a bill of sale.
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your systems fail!?
We have made the presence -obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!
We've seen the fall of the elite.
Bury your life,
Take your disease.
We'll end the world,
when all hope is gone!

We have made the presence -obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!
We've seen the fall of the elite.
Bury your life,
Take your disease.
We'll end the world,
when all hope is gone!

The wretched are the wounded,
The hungry starved to death.
At a place where no-one goes,
the air itself is a final breathe.
So discontinue,
the antisceptic cash charade.
As the cry of justice comes,
Our malignant fire fades.
I am the reason your future suffers.
I am the hatred you won't embrace.
I am the worm of a pure distinction.
I am the remedy, spit in my face!
All your lies and wars are out-dated.
All your subjects are dulling mind games.
I can rattle off a million other reasons why
but doesn't matter when the only thing we love will die.
We have made the presence -obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!
We've seen the fall of the elite.
Bury your life,
Take your disease.
We'll end the world,
when all hope is gone!
We have made the presence -obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!
We've seen the fall of the elite.
Bury your life,
Take your disease.
We'll end the world,
when all hope is gone!作曲 : Hanneman
auschwitz, the meaning of pain
the why that i want you to die
slow death, immense decay
showers that cleanse you of your life
forced in
like cattle you run
stripped of
your life's worth
human mice, for the angel of death
four hundred thousand more to die
angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
sadistic, surgeon of demise
sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race
surgery, with no anesthesia
fell the knife pierce you intensely
inferior, no use to mankind
strapped down screaming out to die

angel of death
monarch to the kingdom of the dead
infamous butcher,
angel of death
pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh, drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold, cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
'til you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust
seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down,
your blood running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants he's creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free

Ahh, Ahhh
Burning now I bring you Hell!

Ahh, Ahhh
Oh, burning now I bring you Hell!
Read me tonight
When the warnings said leave a shudder upon you
Running from all that you feared in your life
Soul of the night
When the sun mislead paint a horror upon you
Marking the moment
Displaying in my ghost of a life!
And I can't get round the way you left me out in the open
To leave me to die!
So how can I
Forget the way you lead me through the path into Heaven
To leave me behind!
Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you Hell!
Ahh, Ahhh
Oh, burning now I bring you Hell!
Free me tonight
As the animal kings breathe their terror upon you
Caught in the moment, engaging in my
Bloodlust tonight, now I can't control my venom's flow
Get back from me demon, or be exorcised!
Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you Hell!

All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you've taken from me
All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you've taken from me
Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Soul of the night, I know
Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you Hell!
Ahh, Ahhh
Oh, burning now I bring you Hell!
Ahh, Ahhh
Oh, burning now I bring you Hell!Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just followed your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight till the end
And this one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle, but you feel so LA
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter na-na-name
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but, honey, I don't know what you're doing to me
Mon chéri, but the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war
And I still love the way I hurt you

I just want to go for a ride
Out and on
Before I set this room alight
Left alone
forever and for crimes unclear
With my patience gone
Someone take me far from here
yeah!
Burning that gasoline
yeah!
Burning that gasoline 
New day yawning
another day of solitaire
House is honest
Clearly more than I bear
Drag me off
Before I set my world on fire
Out and gone
the sun will never set
tonight
yeah!
Burning that gasoline
yeah!
Burning that gasoline
No what for's,
only a can of red
says danger on it
I have found another
way!
Burning that gasoline
yeah!
Burning that gasoline
 
Burning it all away
 
Burning it all awayPut on your war paint
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide
So come on
Put on your war paint
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies
Silver clouds with grey linings
So we can take the world back from a heart attack
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey! young blood!
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass
So we can take the world back from a heart attack
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey! young blood!
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Put on your war paint
The war is won, before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won, before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won, before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love (Wave the white flag!)
The war is won, before it's begun (Wave the white flag!)
Release the doves, surrender love (Wave the white flag!)
Heyyyyyyyy
Young Blood!
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Ich habe alles erreicht
Es ist wahr ich bin ein Held
Und darum ab ich auch viel Geld
Das mir kauft was ich brauch
Und noch ein bißchen mehr
Ich habe tausende von Fans
Und alle lieben mich sehr
Es ist wahr ich bin ein Star
Ich hab Geschichte gemacht
Über Nacht haben sie
mich gross rausgebracht
von der Garage auf die Bühne
in die große weite Welt
Irgendwie hab ich mir trotzdem
alles anders vorgestellt
Es ist wahr ich bin ein Star
Die ganze Welt schaut zu
Ob ich kiffe oder kotze
scheißegal was ich auch tu
Ich bin high bin dabei
Ich muss immer funktioniern
und darum hab ich auch gelernt
mit harten Drogen zu jongliern
Es ist wahr ich bin ein Star
Ich bin ein Plattenmillionär
Ich habe viele Freunde und
es werden immer mehr
Jeden Tag jede Nacht
sind sie bei mir um mir
Zu geben was ich brauch
Damit ich nicht krepier

Wie Phönix aus der Asche

Ja es ist wahr ich bin ein Star
Ich habe alles erreicht
Es ist wahr ich bin ein Held
Meine Hits gehn um die Welt
Sie bewegen und erregen
die Gefühle von so vielen
Bis ans Ende meiner Tage
muss ich weiterspieln
Es ist wahr ich bin ein Star
Ich bade im applaus
Jeden Tag jede Nacht
die ganze Welt ist mein Zuhaus
Vom Bus auf die Bühne
von der Bühne in den Puff
vom Nirvana in den Kater und
dann wieder in den Suff
Es ist wahr ich bin der Held
einer Generation frech und frivol
Ein Idol die Reinkarnation von Rebellion
die jetzt nur noch in der Hölle musiziern
Ich hab so das Gefühl
Ich hab hier nichts mehr zu verliern
Peng peng Kopfschuss
Wie Phönix aus der Asche

Lebe schnell brenne hell

Many have come and gone
Still left out of the guttural swansong
Takin' nothin' but the best in the area
Givin' me grief but ****er I'll stare you
Down 2-3 you're out of there
Maybe it's me but I'm frantic in a panic
Ain't never had a problem since you stopped comin' here
Big man walkin' but ***** I'm still talkin'
Can't you see it's gotta be this way
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （boy）
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （boy）
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （boy）
Gimme any reason not to **** you up

Ain't gonna leave and you know I'm never gone fade
Here it comes again gotta burn again
Time now throw down don't dirty me
Right on your ugly-a** face 'cause
I ain't the one who let you in
And I ain't the one who set you off
But I know damn well when someone's pushing my buttons
Let tell you somethin' I'll push you back

Soon as that camera goes off he's gonna **** that little dog
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （boy）
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （boy）
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （boy）
Gimme any reason not to **** you up
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （*****）
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （*****）
Gimme any reason why I'd need you （*****）
Gimme any reason not to **** you up

Since you never gave a damn in the first place
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
Cuz in the interest of all involved I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty...
...MAN NEARLY KILLED ME
Steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll - you were DEAD FROM THE GIT-GO!
BIG MOUTH ****** - STUPID ******SUCKER
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought
Always is, never was
Foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya -Think I fear ya? BULLSHIT!
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
It's gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, Literal Profanity HIT ME!
SPIT - IT OUT
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Maybe it's the way you spread a lotta rumour fodder
Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realise
Step up, fairy
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome
Straight to the dome
You heard that right, bitch, I didn't stutter
If you know what's good - sit, shut up and beg, brother
Backstab - Don't you know who you're dissin'?
Side swipe - we know THE ASS THAT YOU'RE KISSIN'!
BIGIDY-BIGGIDY BITCH BOY, HALFWAY HAUSER
Can't hear shit cuz I keep gettin' louder
Step up, and you get a face full o' tactic
Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no NUTHIN'
Now you start shit? Well, ain't that somethin'?
Payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
But I'LL FIND YOU - Comin' up behind you!
SPIT - IT OUT
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
'Bout time I set this record straight
All the needlenose punchin' is makin' me irate
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
Where YOU gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools, and all the politix
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got ********** when they passed out the good stuff
Bam
Are you sick of me? GOOD ENOUGH - HAD ENOUGH
****** ME! I'm all out of enemies!
****** ME! I'm all out of enemas!

Can't be sure when it hit that mark
And besides in the mean, mean time
I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the deep details with the devil
From underworld can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you up the cage
On my young, lovers rage, gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark

Writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died
I got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up

It’s not a choice but something inborn
If we fail following our hearts can you blame us. no no no

A square peg in a black hole
We don’t fit in, that’s the way it goes
You shouldn’t act like you’re better than us cause you're not
No no no

This domain in which I live

I see the blood spilling out from the core
Dig my grave of opportunity
Time stalks us all
A scar filled test of who we are

in ein gutes licht gerückt
zeig ich ihm was man machen kann

aus angst weil es mir schlechter geht
versucht sich tiefer noch zu bücken

Was macht ein Mann
was macht ein Mann
der zwischen Mensch und Tier
nicht unterscheiden kann
was
Er wird zu seiner Tochter gehen
sie ist schön und jung an Jahren
und dann wird er wie ein Hund
mit eigen Fleisch und Blut sich paaren
Was tust du
Was fühlst du
Was bist du
doch nur ein Tier
Was macht die Frau
was macht die Frau
die zwischen Tier und Mann
nicht unterscheiden kann
Sie taucht die Feder in sein Blut
schreibt sich selber einen Brief
entseelte Zeilen an die Kindheit
als der Vater bei ihr schlief

Familiar haunts have had enough
Too much thought will give you doubt
And now they found you
It's safer in a cage
They can tell you what to say
All your dreams come with a price, so they own you
But what did you expect?
Was it too much to protect?
Did you understand they had selfish intentions?
When they were pulling you in opposite directions
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override
The dead don't know, the dead are lonely
A fascination fades
When this mercy execution says it's over
You follow as preferred
Now their plans are undeterred
Who can bring them in to supersede? It's over
Even hate starts out as love
Sometimes when it's all you want
Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted
When all that's left is the emotion you abandoned
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override
You clawed out from nothing and I sent you back
Floor to the pedal and lock what you act
Covered in sores you cannot be the one
You are the answer to why we have risen
You are not the way
You are judged to be afraid
You are simple and unchanged
We believe you should give up
Give up
Give up
God and his mercy will take you for granted
When all that's left is a life you abandoned
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground

She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

Okay, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama’s crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me

Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to **** it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, **** it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just **** her one time and be through it forever

But...

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are

Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me

Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night作曲 : Twiggy Ramirez/Madonna Wayne Gacy

All simple monkeys with alien babies
Amphetamines for boys
Crucifixes for ladies
Sampled and soulless
Worldwide and real webbed
You sell all the living
For more safer dead

Anything to belong Anything to belong

Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all that were fed
So **** all your protests and
Put them to bed

God is in the t.v.

1,000 mothers are praying for it
Were so full of hope
And so full of shit
Build a new god
To medicate and to ape
Sell us ersatz
Dressed up and real fake

Anything to belong Anything to belong
Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all that were fed
So **** all your protests and
Put them to bed

God is in the t.v.

Rock is deader than dead

You're on the edge of a nerve-racking force

insanity and abnormality careful what you call reality
What you will, always want

INCOMING!作曲 : Tägtgren
There's something coming crawling
'Round the corner of your mind
Oh... your funeral has just begun
Buried alive, it will be over in no time
The date is set for tonight
VIP at the dead man's ball

Come and die with the zombies in the moonlight
They become alive when you die, you cannot fool them
You got to slam with the dead and let it go now
See a thousand hallowed eyes stare into the night

The sun goes down and the dead head minds,
They start to resurrect
Under the velvet sky and thirsty for your flesh
Steals your soul and you will lose control
And turns your tears into dust
You're fool that will never learn
Play with fire and you will get your fingers burned

Come and die with the zombies in the moonlight
They become alive when you die, you cannot fool them
You got to slam with the dead and let it go now
See a thousand hallowed eyes stare into the night

It's getting dark so prepare to die
They're coming after you
It's getting dark and you can't get away
They're coming after you

Come and die with the zombies in the moonlight
They become alive when you die, you cannot fool them
You got to slam with the dead and let it go now
See a thousand hallowed eyes stare into the night

Come and die with the zombies in the moonlight
They become alive when you die, you cannot fool them
You got to slam with the dead and let it go now
See a thousand hallowed eyes stare into the nightHere to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge
Our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin&apos;s Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Soul full of thunder
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla&apos;s door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we for
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day bent will die
Oh Glory and fame
Oh Blood is our name
Oh Souls full of thunder
Oh Hearts of steel
Oh Killers of men
Oh Of warriors friend
Oh Sworn to avenge
Oh Sons of the gods
Today we shall die
Oh Open Valhalla&apos;s door
Oh Let the battle begin
Oh Hail Gods of War
Oh Hail
Oh Gods
Oh of War
Onward into the heart of the battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth
From their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited
For the broken shells
That once were bodies
Thus Odin alone
Would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto
Them The Berserker Rage
Now gods embed
They grows up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would hurt them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before
Them died that day

Viaton on hymysi, vaikka liassa on käsi
Häpeätkö ollenkaan noita tekemisiäsi?
Tuskin kukaan sinua jäisi ikävöimään
Jos vankilasi avaimen heitän menemään
Milloinkaan ei saavu aamu
Tahratonko sielusi, vaikka ryvettyisit
Ei enää ketään kenelle valheitasi myisit
Ovat sanelemat pirun ja röyhkeytesi työt
Olkoon laitimmainen kerta kun pöydässäni syöt
Pirunkieli(x4)
Pirunkieli - Todenpieli(x3)
Pirunkieli - Pirunkieli
Lammasmainen hymysi, mutta veressä kätesi
Tajuatko ollenkaan, että mikä sinuun pesi
Hapantukoon kuseksi vuosikertaviini
Ja odottakoon sinua tylsä giljotiini
Miten saisit asettumaan tuon pelonhorkan
Entä miten katseilta piiloon pukinsorkan
Ovat sanelemat pirun ja ahneutesi yöt
Nyt et lepoa saa päivin ja valvot kaiket yötAnother night ride
On the open road
Tryin' lo reach our destination
We go round and around
Runnin' from town to town
(Another white line)
Another white line
Stretchin' out ahead
Run the road out across the nation
It goes around and around
Playin' in one more town
I still get this feeling inside
Turn it out
Give it light and sound
Here I go again
Heartbreak Road
Taking us through another night
On Heartbreak Road, ooh yeah
Another night ride
Down the highway
Tryin' to raise up our destination
I got wheels on fire, wheels on fire
Runnin' from town to town
I can still hear the crowd in my ear
Set it up
Tear it down
And here I go again
Heartbreak Road
Taking us through another night
On Heartbreak Road
All over the world
Heartbreak Road
Taking us on through the night
On Heartbreak Road
Taking us on through the night

Heartbreak Road
Taking us on through the night
On Heartbreak Road
Heartbreak Road
Taking us on through the night
On Heartbreak Road
All over the world
Heartbreak Road
Taking us, taking us

I got lots of jealous lovers that all wish they had me back
Got a pistol for a mouth, my old mama gave me that
Making my own road out of gravel and some wine
And if I have to fall then it won't be in your line
Everybody's doing it so why the hell should I
Everybody's doing it so why the hell should I
I'm a bad woman to keep
Make me mad, I'm not here to please
Paint me in a corner but my colour comes back
Once you go black, you never go back
I'm a black sheep
I'm a black sheep
I wasn't born a beauty queen but I'm okay with that
Maybe radio won't mind if I sing a little flat
I wear my boots to bed, hang a cross up on the wall
To save me from a shallow grave that wants to take us all
Everybody's doing it so why the hell should I
Everybody's doing it so why the hell should I
I'm a bad woman to keep
Make me mad, I'm not here to please
Paint me in a corner but my colour comes back
Once you go black, you never go back
I'm a black sheep

.These are the eyes and the lies of the taken
These are their hearts
but their hearts don’t beat like ours
They burn ‘cause they are all afraid
For every one of us, there’s an army of them
But you’ll never fight alone
‘Cause I wanted you to know
.
That the world is ugly
But you’re beautiful to me
Well are you thinking of me now
.
These are the nights and the lights that we fade in
These are the words but the words aren’t coming out
They burn ‘cause they are hard to say
For every failing sun, there’s a morning after
Though I’m empty when you go
I just wanted you to know
.
That the world is ugly
But you’re beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me
Like I’m thinking of you
I would say I’m sorry, though
Though I really need to go
I just wanted you to know
.
I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I’m thinking of you every night, every day
.
These are the eyes and the lies of the taken
These are their hearts
but their hearts don’t beat like ours
They burn ‘cause they are all afraid
When mine beats twice as hard
.
‘Cause the world is ugly
But you’re beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me
Like I’m thinking of you
I would say I’m sorry, though
Though I really need to go
I just wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
I just wanted you to know
But you’re beautiful to me
I just wanted you to know
Are you thinking of me
.
Stop your crying, helpless feeling
Dry your eyes and start believing
There’s one thing they’ll never take from you
.
And we’ll never be the same
Like ghosts in the snow
Like ghosts in the sunMama take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
in dark too dark to see
Feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is coming down
Feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door

Magic mirror on the wall please tell me now Why we fall?
Looking back upon a time human race has fallen down
To destruction, chaos and hate - we can change it, it's not too late
We just must gather all, standing up, we shouldn't fall

So gather now
We are going to fight
In the name of our...Arising!
Sadness and darkness that is all I can see
Arising that is all for we should believe
So crush your fright I'll be with you
Using our wisdom we are ready to do (it)
You must know it so I also say enough victim enough pain
We just must gather all, standing up, we shouldn't fall

So gather now
We are going to fight
In the name of our...ArisingThe pictures tell the story
This life had many shades
I'd wake up every morning and before I'd start each day
I'd take a drag from last night's cigarette
That smoldered in its tray
Down a little something and then be on my way
I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn't be alone
Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue
I ain't winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I've got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
This one's for the mighty sea
Mischief, gold and piracy
This one's for the man that raised me
Taught me sacrifice and bravery
This one's for our favorite game
Black and gold, we wave the flag
This one's for my family name
With pride I wear it to the grave
I've got your name written here,
This one means the most to me
Stays here for eternity
A ship that always stays the course
An anchor for my every choice
A rose that shines down from above
I signed and sealed these words in blood
I heard them once, sung in a song
It played again and we sang along
You'll always be here with me
Even if you're gone
You'll always have my love
Our memory will live on
I've got your name written here in a rose tattoo
With pride I'll wear it to the grave for you
Signed and sealed in blood I would die for youHard to notice
Difficult to understand
The mind of a broken man
Those strained hands can't grasp
As he crawls from the gutter
To make a final stand
My mouth is full of dirt
I won't last and it's not good
Can't even see the sights
And my headlights are broke
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
At the speed of the black light
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
I lost my way back home
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
I'm falling off the edge
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
Would i have made the same choices
Without you by my side
Would i have made the same mistakes
Without you breathing down my neck
The stood by my side till the end
Crushed me
With all their fake love
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
At the speed of the black light
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
I'm falling off the edge
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
I lost my way back home
I lift my hands off the wheel
I let the black light guide me
I lift my hands off the wheel
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
At the speed of the black light
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
I lost my way back home
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the world
I'm falling off the edge
Just a worn-out soul at the end of the worldI am flesh and I am bone.
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter...
Like glitter and gold.
Like glitter...

Do you walk in the valley of kings?
Do you walk in the shadow of men
who sold their lives to a dream?
Do you ponder the manner of things,
in the dark...
the dark, the dark, the dark...

I am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter...
Like glitter and gold.
Like glitter...

Do you walk in the meadow of spring?
Do you talk to the animals?
Do you hold their lives from a string?
Do you ponder the manner of things
in the dark...
the dark, the dark, the dark...

I am flesh and I am bone.
Arise, ting ting, like glitter and gold.
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter...

spinning up...
You don't remember what you're asking for
And everybody's in the front room's
tripping out...
You left your bottle at the door

Don't know what you're asking for...
And everybody's in the front room's

Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

You're sick of feeling down
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me and take my hand
When the lights go out you will understand

Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Anger and agony
Are better than misery
Trust me I've got a plan
When the lights go off you will understand

Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing
Rather feel pain

I know (I know I know I know I know)
That you're wounded
You know (You know you know you know you know)
That I'm here to save you
You know (You know you know you know you know)
I'm always here for you
I know (I know I know I know I know)
That you'll thank me later
Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough

mad-ness  has  now  come  over  meSeven seas and seven wonders
Seven poisons seven blasts
Only bad news for tomorrow
If tomorrow comes at last
Burning bridges and fey valleys
Bleeding rivers and toxic weeds
It's our turn to fire the fuse now
First we'll clean the surface and then we'll sow the seeds
From the ashes of love we will rise again
From this devastated trust and all this mess
From the ruins of love we'll get up again
And our overwhelming hope will do the rest
From the ashes of love,we'll rise again  x3
We'll rise again
Seven hills and seven deserts
Walls of clouds on frightening skies
Thirsty fields and starving vultures
As a black sun melts the ice
Hearts of stone and lousy liars
From their heads down to their feet
It's our turn to change the rules now
First we'll clean the surface and then we'll sow the seeds
From the ahes of love we will rise again
From this devastated trust and all this mess
From the ruins of love we'll get up again
And our overwehlming hope will do the rest
From the ashes of love,we'll rise again  x3
Interlude Pt.1

I'm bleeding ya
Bleeding in ways of the fire burned
I'm crying ya
Crying in ways of the nightbird
No more is there one to lay by my side
I'm straying ya
Straying in nightmares all the time
A little something I know
A little somewhere I go
Reminds me of you
To blossom blue,
Is to blossom without you
To blossom blue,
I'm breaking breaking but I cannot bear to
I'm staring staring but I cannot see you
For no more are you to lay by my side
I'm weeping no more then this second time
A little something I know
A little somewhere I go
Where the sweet waters flow, reminds me of you
A little something I know
A little somewhere I go
Where the sweet waters flow
Where the mistletoes grow,
Reminds me of you
To blossom blue,
 Is to blossom without you
To blossom blue,
 Is to blossom without you作词 : Brennare



Leaving with twilight though I was chosen
To wander the way in the darkest of nights
Oh in the summer sun how soon I came to stray
A true damnation when I turned away

So fell autumn rain washed away ali my pain
I feel brighter somehow lighter somehow to breath once again
So fell autumn rain washed my sorrows away
With the sunset behind somehow I find the dreams are to stay

So fell autumn rain

Blinded by dawning so you would take me
Further away away from the fall
Oh you told me I must never dream again
A true damnation you left me the pain

So fell autumn rain but all things must pass

 all things must pass
So fell autumn rain washed away all my pain
I feel brighter somehow lighter somehow to breath once again
So tell autumn rain washed my sorrows away
With the sunset behind somehow I find the dreams are to stay

I can't escape this hell
So many times i've tried
But i'm still caged inside
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one would ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal, this animal)
I can't escape myself
(I can't escape myself)
So many times i've lied
(So many times i've lied)
But there's still rage inside

Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one would ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
Somebody help me through this nightmare
I can't control myself
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
I can't escape this animal

This animal,
this animal,
this animal,
this animal,
this animal,

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?

The plan of invasion an evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches, to slave them all
To make them kneel for a new god
The guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We re outnumbered
B8ut our destiny is to win!
Fight! With the rage of a bear!
Defend! Our homeland!
Crush! Every enemy!
And seal our victory!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Ei urhot kaukaisen pohjolan
Uhan eess? taipuneet
J?lleen pauhaa kansi taivahan
Veri valuu maahan lumiseen
Moni n?hd? ei saa en?? huomista
Moni j?? heit? kaipaamaan

When the beasts come out and play
The headlines made it clear
Judgement day is near
They're crawling down the street
Sinking their razor teeth
They're knocking on every door
Now the steel begins to glow
They're vapourizing the earth, no mercy
Into the battle they thrust
With power and lust
Oh-oh-oh...
Punish and enslave
Oh-oh-oh...
Punish and enslave
There's something, a single spark
Out there in the dark
The metal is shining bright
Brings back hope and light
Bumber-to-bumber he reigns the wasteland
Turning their steel into dust, he will never rust
Oh-oh-oh...
Punish and enslave
Oh-oh-oh...
Punish and enslave
All hail the chosen one - Fight proud, don't touch the sun
Come join our steel parade - Together in the last crusade
All drop the hammers down - Burn out, reclaim the crown
Speed demons never turn - at speed of light we ride, running flat-out let's crash and burn
They're vapourizing the earth, no mercy
Into the battle they thrust
Bumber-to-bumber he reigns the wasteland
Turning their steel into dust, he will never rust
Oh-oh-oh...
Punish and enslave
Oh-oh-oh...
Punish and enslave
Oh-oh-oh...

Oh-oh-oh...
Punish and enslaveDo you feel the thorns?
Do you see the tears?
Do you see the bloodshed in this fell war?
Have you forsaken us?
Have you forgotten our faithful men calling your name?
While I stand before you
While we perish
While I lay down a crimson rose
While holding hands are forced apart
While hopes bog like condemned men
Were you there?
The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself upon to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere
In your nemeton
These grey stone walls are cold and silent
As the fallen mother gone deaf
Mistress of shattered hopes
And forever broken dreams
Were you there?
The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself upon to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere
Epo, Epo, why has thou forsaken me?
Together we go unsung
Into thy hand I commend my spirit
Together we go down with our people
Were you there?
Were you there?
The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself upon to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere
Falling on me...Friend or foe, there's no way to know
In the battlefield of life it's kill or be killed
So many times it's a matter of degrees
From being up on your luck to down on your knees
It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal
They try to change you, crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are
It's times like these when lines are drawn
Which side of the fence are you swinging on?
There will come one day not so far away
When the hunter becomes the prey (and you will pay)
It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal
They try to change you, crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are
This is ****ing war!
They try to change you, crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you areGaze at the leaving clairvoyant
Predicting invasions and pain
A child can see through the stranger...
The Watcher's eye, the noble liar
It's time for the merchant and his help for sale...
Blades to cut wicked flesh
On a merchantman he counts his money
Then he sails away
The sea he'll cruise is blood and fire
Oh father I can't see a lane
They make you a pawn in the game
For we all are deaf, dumb and blind
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chains
When you're off to the hall of the serpent
See the cynic who's counting his gold
While gun runners, priests and clairvoyants
Are dancing around the rising demon
You are taught to eat up all the crap they shit
Parading your nuts on a silver plate
Kill your brother by the blade they sell
For you don't unite
They reap your bondage sowing evil
There's no use to tell what I've seen
They know how to make you believe
Just what they want you to know
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chain
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chain
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chain作曲 : Lindroos, Planman, Ranta

I am here again
when the day is done
I'm back again

Staring right into your eyes

I'll take away your life
and end your pain inside
I wan't to die with you, like you
I am the deadly stalker
I am the Midnight Walker
the one you try to hide
Now say your life goodbye
I'm the shadow behind you
that you can't see
but you know it's there
The day is rising
and I'm fading away
Daytime has made you free
but only for today
Dusk is falling
and once again
I'm in your head

I'm your nightmare,
fantasy and insanity
Only thing you see
death will make you free
So walk a little closer
and give your life to me
Let me end your pain

I'll take away your life
and end your pain inside
I wan't to die with you, like you
I am the deadly stalker
I am the Midnight Walker

Now say your life goodbye

I'll take away your life
and end your pain inside
I wan't to die with you, like you
I am the deadly stalker
I am the Midnight Walker

Now say your life goodbye
----favor-----无歌词无歌词I wish I was free of this
I see her in my dreams
Wish that she wasn't there
But she still haunts me and I still feel her breath on me
Still want to taste her skin
But I know that would kill me
No, damn her
Still, I choke on her lies
Still reeling from her last caress, her goodbye
Oh how this sickens me
This wretched fool's affair
I can't erase this from me
And now it permeates in every thought I feel
The anger writhes in my soul
No, damn her
Still, I feel my stomach turn
Choke back, hold my head high, I'm strong
No, damn her
Still, I choke on her lies
Not reeling
I'm strong
Damn her
Still, I feel my stomach turn
Choke back, hold my head high, I'm strong
(No) Damn her
Still, I choke on her lies
Not reeling
I'm strong
I wish I was free of thisI am alive and now undead

These are events that can't be stopped
They have been stalking you for years
The blood that runs through my dead corpse

You can't kill what has no heartbeat
Left inside it
A severed dream
Now fades away
Black as night
Now dead
In the bright
Of daylight
I am alive and now undead
The walking terror is unleashed
Your slow death is just what i'll reap
Zombie Blood Curse

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think I'm insame because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy

Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?

Oh yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness' I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late作曲 : Twiggy Ramirez/Chris Vrenna
 作词 : Marilyn Manson

Remember when I took you up to the top of the hill
We had our knives drawn
They were as sharp as we were in love
If God crossed us we'd take all his drugs
Burn his money and his house down and wait for the fire to spread
Sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
Together as one against all others
Break all of their wings and make sure that it crashes
We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today

I had no choice to erase the debt of our families
Let you say goodbye with lips like dynamite
Everyone turned their backs cause they knew
When we held on tight to each other
We were something fatal that fell into the wrong hands
Sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
Together as one against all others
Break all of their wings and make sure that it crashes
We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today
We don't seek death, we seek destruction
Death, we seek destruction
We don't seek death, we seek destruction
Death, we seek destruction

We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
But I don't know if the world will end today
We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today
See a new beginning rise behind the sun
We could never catch up to them as fast as we run
See a new beginning rise behind the sun
We could never catch up to them as fast as we run

Revenge
I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong
I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress

Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined

Possessed
I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength
The strength of many to crush
Who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger
can better any medicine under the sun

Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined


There comes a time within everyone
to close your eyes to what's real

No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest Let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line.
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
NO ONE can piss on this determination作曲 : Dave Mustaine

The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask youre wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry ow
And when the story takes a twist
If folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry
The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravitys got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again
And again and again, again
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke

The  warming  sun  returns  again
And  melts  away  the  snow
The  sea  is  freed  from  icy  chains
Winter  is  letting  go
Standing  on  the  ocean  side
We  can  hear  the  waves
Calling  us  out  with  tide
To  sail  into  our  fate
Oden
Guide  our  ships
Our  axes,spears  and  swords
Guide  us  through  storms  that  whip
And  in  brutal  war
Our  ships  await  us  by  the  shore
Time  has  come  to  leave
Our  country,family  and  homes
For  riches  in  the  east
Some  of  us  won ’t  return
But  that  won ’t  bring  us  down
Our  fate  is  written  in  the  web
Woven  by  the  Norns
A  ram  is  sacrificed
Across  the  longship ’s  bow
And  as  we  set  our  sails
A  strong  breeze  starts  to  blow
It  carries  us  out  to  sea
with  hope  of  fame  and  pride
And  glorious  all  will  be
that  with  sword  in  hand  will  die

Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Beaten why for
Can't take much more
here we go, here we go, here we go...
One - Nothing wrong with me
Two - Nothing wrong with me
Three - Nothing wrong with me
Four - Nothing wrong with me
One - Something's got to give
Two - Something's got to give
Three - Something's got to give
Now!!!
Let the bodies hit the floor
AaAaAaAaAh!!!!
Push me again
This is the end
Skin against skin blood and bone
You're all by yourself but you're not alone
You wanted in now you're here
Driven by hate consumed by fear
Let the bodies hit the floorTurning it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later you're gonna come loose
What the **** you gonna do?
Your body's swaying from side to side
I wanna catch you when you fall
But then you'll learn nothing at all
Still I'm ready to run but you're so damn drunk
An atomic bomb couldn't wake up you
What's that you hear, bass and lights from the club?
I don't think so, I'm by your side and all I can hear
Is that your mom's starting to cry, screaming
Help me, help me, help me
The way that she looks
Turning it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later you're gonna come loose
What the **** you gonna do?
Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken and she'll never be saved
Suck it up, you ****ed it up
The way she walks, the way she talks
We all know the girl is halfway dead, dead, dead
You're selling your soul for whiskey and coke
And you're a suicide for tequila and lime
And I gotta admit when I first saw you
Hit the dance floor with your grind
You sent me outta my mind
But after watching you crawl in the door
That it is getting old and sold and I told
I don't know but you're screaming
I don't care, I don't care, care, care, care
The way that she looks
Turning it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later you're gonna come loose
What the **** you gonna do?
Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken and she'll never be saved
Suck it up, you ****ed it up
Turning it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later you're gonna come loose
What the **** you gonna do?
Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken and she'll never be saved
Suck it up, you ****ed it up
The way she walks, the way she talks
We all know the girl is halfway dead
The way she died, the way she said
We all know the girl is halfway dead
Dead, dead, halfway dead
When I see you lately
Dead, dead, halfway dead
I'm wondering on
White roses, caskets
Your name on a stone
Turning it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Turning it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later you're gonna come loose
What the **** you gonna do?
Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken and she'll never be saved
Suck it up, you ****ed it up
Turning it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos

What the **** you gonna do?
Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken and she'll never be saved
Suck it up, you ****ed it up
The way she walks, the way she talks
We all know the girl is halfway dead
The way she died, the way she said
We all know the girl is halfway deadI’ve got the reach and the teeth of a killin’ machine,
with a need to bleed you when the light goes green
best believe, I’m in a zone to be, from my Yin to my Yang to my Yang Tze
put a grin on my chin when you come to me,
‘cuz I’ll win, I’m a one-of-a-kind and I’ll bring death
to the place you’re about to be: another river of blood runnin’ under my feet
forged in a fire lit long ago, stand next to me, you’ll never stand alone
I’m last to leave, but the first to go, Lord, make me dead before you make me old
I feed on the fear of the devil inside of the enemy faces in my sights:
aim with the hand, shoot with the mind, kill with a heart like arctic ice
I am a soldier and I’m marching on
I am a warrior and this is my song

I bask in the glow of the rising war, lay waste to the ground of an enemy shore
wade through the blood spilled on the floor, and if another one stands I’ll kill some more
bullet in the breach and a fire in me, like a cigarette thrown, to gasoline
if death don’t bring you fear, I swear, you’ll fear these marchin’ feet
Come to the nightmare, come to me, deep down in the dark where the devil be
in the maw with the jaws and the razor teeth,
where the brimstone burns and the angel weeps
call to the gods if I cross your path and my silhouette hangs like a body bag
hope is a moment now long past, the shadow of death is the one I cast.
I am a soldier and I’m marching on
I am a warrior and this is my song
my eyes are steel and my gaze is long
I am a warrior and this is my song
now I live lean and I mean to inflict the grief,
and the least of me is still out of your reach
the killing machine’s gonna do the deed,
until the river runs dry and my last breath leaves
chin in the air with a head held high,
I’ll stand in the path of the enemy line
feel no fear, know my pride:
for God and Country I’ll end your life
I am a soldier and I’m marching on
I am a warrior and this is my song
my eyes are steel and my gaze is long
I am a warrior and this is my song作曲 : Dominia

09. Mountains Of God's Depression
The beggarly old man was sick and infirm
He was standing alone on the road
Miserable angel was visiting him
Someone was crucified the day before

They were talking for a long time
And in tears they were walking to the sky
And the holy son who brings no crime
Came down carefully in the night

He said then: he will return
But now he must fly into the sky
At last He said, they were listening taciturn
Everybody will be saved by the light

Mountains of God's Depression
rising up from the Earth
The son came back soon and was glad
He had come but his father was sad
The chosen people offended his child
The Great Creator was silent.

And the angels were crying in scare
In embrace of depressive smell
Mighty father was thinking in care
And devil was loathing in hell

Mountains of God's Depression

Star Of The County Down
In Banbridge Town in the County Down
One morning last July
From a boreen green came a sweet colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by
She looked so sweet fronn her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was really there
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head
And I looked with a feelin' rare
And I say's, say's I, to a passer-by
Whose the maid with the nut brown hair'?
He smiled at me and he says
That's the gem of Ireland's crown
It's Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
She's the star of the County Down
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Ouay and
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough turns rust coloured brown
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Ouay and
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County DownUnity is a rare thing
Blind eyes of society bring
The category of minority
Now what are we supposed to be?
Born free to be
Powerless to change the world
With our lives in the hands of madmen

Now in times when society needs us
This is where the sin begins
We're aware they're going to free us
Rage from our hearts within
Born of this world
Which is a living hell
But we'll be closer to heaven

So now
This is the art
To shred
It's only emotion
Now
This is the art
To shred
It's only emotion

Shred

So now
This is the art
To shred
It's only emotion
This is the art
To shred
It's only emotion

Shreddeeper shades of red descending
smear our names, the stains unending
turn forgiveness,break the lens distorted
crush the infidel and turn about
famine in our hearts, bring up the silence louder
eradicate the lungs and take us higher
these are the wonders at your feet
weighed upon a wider scale
afraid to see what takes us down
sing destruction, sing of unfullfillment
search abandoned, let the blood be fevered
ridden of the self provided things get easier
ignite our minds and let's burn brighter
these are the wonders at your feet * nEverybody hurts, everybody bleeds,
everybody bends to feel or need.
Everybody's born with their own curse
and I'm not alone.
Everybody cries, everybody breathes,
everybody wants to feel they're free.
Deep inside I know
what I am worth, a life of my own.
It could have been much worse
but it should have been better.
I know I hurt you, deserted you,
and now I see it clear.
I pulled you closer, tighter,
cause I knew you'd disappear.
I just can't compromise, apologize,
there's nothing you can say.
Oh we both knew,
it would always end this way.
Everybody pains, everybody breathes,
everybody's making off like thieves.
Every soul's aching for release,
you're not alone.
Everybody lives, everybody leaves,
everybody prays rest on their knees.
Everybody's got the same disease,
no one's alone.
It could have been much worse
but it should have been better.
I know I hurt you, deserted you,
and now I see it clear.
I pulled you closer, tighter,
cause I knew you'd disappear.
I just can't compromise, apologize,
there's nothing you can say.
Oh we both knew, it'd always end this way.
Knew it'd always end this way.
We knew it'd always end this way.
I know I hurt you, deserted you,
and now I see it clear.
I pulled you closer, tighter,
cause I knew you'd disappear.
I just can't compromise, apologize,
there's nothing you can say.
Oh we both knew, it would always end this way.
We both knew it'd always end this way.
We both knew, it would always end this way.无歌词In the Still of the Night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the Still of the Night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

In the shadow of night
I see the full moon rise
Telling me what's in store,
My body star shaking
My heart start aching
And I can't take no more, no, no

Now I just wanna get close to you
An' taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat...

In the Still of the Night...
In the Still of the Night...
Over here baby...

In the heat of the day
I hang my head down low
And hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day
Until the evening time
I'm waiting for the night to come

In the Still of the Night,
In the cool moonlight,
I feel heart is aching
In the Still of the Night...

I can't give away
I can't give away
I can't give away

In the Still of the Night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door...
In the Still of the Night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more...

Now I just wanna get close to you
An' taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat.

In the Still of the Night...

Still of the Night,
Still of the Night,
Still of the Night...
Still of the Night,
Still of the Night,
Still of the Night…
Still of the Night,
Still of the Night,
Still of the Night…I’m a whisper lost upon wind
I’m the ember that will burn you down
I’m the water that will drown you
I’m a star that’s just a black hole now
I’m a terrifying danger
I’m fruit decaying on the ground
I’m a swallower of anger
I’m the tree that falls and makes no sound
I make no sound…
‘Cause if I stand up, I’ll break my bones
And everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain’t nobody giving up, ’cause nobody gives a ****
Stand up and break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can’t hold
There’s nobody praying for me
I am fungus in the forest
I’m a lizard with a poison tongue
I’m the child in the manger
I’m the one who sacrificed his son
Rust is showing on my armor
I am wheezing like an old man… done
I’m a product of my anger
I’m the bullet in a loaded gun
Stand up, I’ll break my bones
And everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain’t nobody giving up, ’cause nobody gives a ****
Stand up and break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can’t hold
There’s nobody praying for me
‘Cause if I stand up, I’ll break my bones
And everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain’t nobody giving up, ’cause nobody gives a ****
Stand up and break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can’t hold
There’s nobody praying for me
(There’s nobody praying for me)
There’s nobody praying for meTransmission third world war third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you re looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured
Silent play in the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The cameras eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the fistagons the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks
Who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above **** it cut the cord

The sky was blond like her
It was a day to take the child
Out back and shoot it
I should have buried all my dead
Up in her cemetery head
She had dirty word witchcraft
I was in the deep end of her skin
Then, it seemed like a one car wreck
But I knew it was a horrid tragedy
Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear
Blow out the candles
On all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You will taste like Valentine’s
We cry
You’re like a birthday
I should have picked the photograph
It lasted longer than you
Putting holes in happiness
We’ll paint the future black
If it needs any color
My death sentence is a story
Who’ll be digging when you finally let me die?
The romance of our assassination
If you’re Bonnie, I’ll be your Clyde
But the grass is greener here
And I can see all of your snakes
You wear your ruins well
Please run away with me to hell
Blow out the candles
On all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You will taste like Valentine’s
We cry
You’re like a birthday
I should have picked the photograph
It lasted longer than you
Blow out the candles
On all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You will taste like Valentine’s

Darling you gotta let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I′ll be here ′til the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
It's always tease tease tease
You′re happy when I′m on my knees
One day is fine, next is black
So if you want me off your back
Well come on and let me know
Should I Stay or should I go?
Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
An′ if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know
This indecision′s bugging me
If you don′t want me, set me free
Exactly who′m I′m supposed to be
Don′t you know which clothes even fit me?
Come on and let me know
Should I cool it or should I blow?

Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So you come on and let me know
Should I cool it or should I blow?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So you gotta let me know
Should I stay or should I go?Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems
Can you feel my love buzz?

Would you believe me when I do you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you

Nirvana！！！！！！You destroyed me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more
I guess there's nothing left to talk about tonight

How many times have I had it and lost it?
They bring up the past, I'm changing the topic
And everybody's telling me to give up and drop it
Echoing constant, but failure is not an option
Don't be obnoxious, I'm losing my conscience
I'd rather be the nail than the one in the coffin
The one you've forgotten's got nothing else left to hide
Because I never told the truth but now its coming to life
It's like

You destroyed me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more
I guess there's nothing left to talk about
And I just don't care anymore
If that's the way it has to be
Then break your teeth
When you take a bite of me

Can we get back to the basics?
The days all seem so faded
A smile on my face everyday because I faked it
And I can't take the face in the mirror so lets face it
Worst sleep in years 'cause fear makes you complacent
So I just pile it out, everything I'm about
So busy walking on your tightrope, I figured it out
So here we go, here I am
It's not for me or for them
'Cause we forgive and forget
And then we do it again

You destroyed me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more
I guess there's nothing left to talk about
And I just don't care anymore
So find another way to break me down
And make it hard like you did before
If that's the way it has to be
Then break your teeth
When you take a bite of me

(You destroyed me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more)
We're headed for the grave!

You destroyed me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more
I guess there's nothing left to talk about
And I just don't care anymore
So find another way to break me down
And make it hard like you did before
If that's the way it has to be
Then break your teeth
When you take a bite of me无歌词作词 : Told
The drugs begin to peak
A smile of joy arrives in me
But sudation changes to panic and nausea
I will save myself!
And breathe starts to shorten
And heartbeats felt softer
You won't try to save me
You just want to hurt me
And leave me desperate
You taught my heart
The sense I never knew I had
I can't forget
The times that I was lost and depressed from the awful truth
How do you do it?
You're my heroine
You won't leave me alone
Tears of my heart turn to stone
I've given everything
You taught my heart
The sense I never knew I had
I can't forget
The times that I was lost and depressed from the awful truth
How do you do it?
You're my heroine
I bet you laugh
At the thought of me thinking for myself
I bet you believe
That I'm better off with you then someone else
Your face arrives again
A hope I had become so real
But under your covers
More torture then pleasure
And just passed your lips
There's more anger then laughter
Not now or forever will I ever change you?
I know that to go on I'll break you my habit
You taught my heart
The sense I never knew I had
I can't forget
The times that I was lost and depressed from the awful truth
How do you do it?
You're my heroine
I will save myself!There's more to life than what could ever meet the eyes.
So don't take a step back,
The crowd's wild, and I'm ready to feed them.
They need this, a big mess.
I'll keep spitting in this mic 'til the feast's end.
I'm stressed out, but I breathe here.
Oh, I could die for this.
Can you hear me loud and clear now? (clear now)
Why can't you sing along?
Sing your ****ing heart out.
I'm sure you'll make it out alive.
You'll make it out.alive.
This place is all we have, here and now.
I'd like to live this forever (forever)
I want to feel the ground once the bottle sounds hollow
The show is over.
This is all I'll ever have I guess.
This is all I've got to light my way,
And those moments are priceless.
I can't forget the miles, I walked.
I can't forget a single step..
Since I left the warmth of a "home".
I'm so tired to see that I have been mislead.
It was a long road 'round the core.
When your eyes devour me,
I think that my only will is to simply look alive..
'Cause I feel dead when I'm out.
I can't bear my heartbeats in my chest,
And my mind is such a deep mess
I can't stand to see
This ****ing disaster the world made of me,
I'm so sick.
I'm just a man, a son of this pitiful world.
I can't feel the touch on my skin unless it burns.
Am I alive?
Can you hear me loud and clear now? (clear now)
Why can't you sing along?
Sing your ****ing heart out.
I'm sure you'll make it out alive.
You'll make it out.alive.
This place is all we have, here and now.
I'd like to live this forever (forever)
I want to feel the ground once the bottle sounds hollow
The show is over.
This place is all we've got here and now,
It's time to let us be
Can you hear me loud and clear?
It's time to let us live.无歌词Looking back on my footsteps on the cold ground
Feeling like fleeing
They say the path I took should be my fate
But I wanna take my lazy steps on my own
Day by day, second by second, I set the course anew
Walking through the frames of my life
Looking for the moments I'll remember with a smile
Tripping over lies and hate
Envy and vanity
I wish I could change the order of proceedings
No chance at all
No chance at all
I build a time machine
I will reverse my mistakes, pain - fade away
Fade away
Fade away
All these sources of noise are whispering and screaming
Tempting and frightening in the middle of my head, beyond my heart
They try to change my mind into something bad
Fighting against them for years
But in the end I still decide on my own
Fearing the mistakes
Fearing the responsibility
To myself and to my beloved, to my beloved
Walking through the frames of my life
Looking for the moments I'll remember with a smile
Tripping over lies and hate
Envy and vanity
I wish I could change the order of proceedings
These photos, can't overlook (can't overlook)
The flashlights, they are surrounding me

Observing all my movements
But finally it's me who's crying for my perfect sincerity
Crying for my salvation
Crying for the respect for myself

So where is the golden means of all decisions?
I don't even know
If there is a right way I could choose

I go down on my knees, I'm yelling at the ground
In the hope of finding some new answers

Thousands of questions
Only one life for finding answers
One question for thousands of lives
For thousands of lives
Breathing slowly

Despite this I never stopped believing in
Waiting for the point I can see it clearlyAgain he sees the end, it's light that blinds his eyes
Creatures of the night are calling him to darkness
Creatures of the night are calling him to darkness
The darkness is here, it has killed the light
Only one more war to fight



Last breath was taken now in the dark of the night
Cold kiss of death will end this war
Silence is there when the warrior is dying
Last breath was taken when he died
Again he feels the breeze, it haunts him forevermore
There is no time to waste when he sees the stormy sky
Today is the day of war, today I'm longing to die
On this ice of eternity norther kills the light

Last breath was taken now in the dark of the night
Cold kiss of death will end this war
Silence is there when the warrior is dying
Last breath was taken when he died"הנני מביא את המבול מים על הארץ..... לשחת כל בשר אשר בו רוח חיים מתחת השמיים..... כל אשר בארץ יגוע,ומחיתי את היקום אשר עשיתי מעל פני האדמה..." 
May the lord eternal save his troubled child 
As he passes through rain and storm 
Behind the walls of this hallowed ark of wood 
Our holey prophets found a revelation, which they have understood 
Onto the lands of fearful heaven comes a flood erasing all 
Landing as if a ruthless bird of prey to crush all human souls 
The lightning colors the sky with flames of light 
Hell shines above us and the fires bright 
Erasing the works of the common man, all we hold dear is set alight "ביום הזה נבקעו כל מעיינות תהום רבה... וארובות השמיים נפתחו.... וימי המבול היו על הארץ..." 
Shattered glass reflects this shattered world barren is the landscape here 
Thunder roars as a lion caged, heat that comes like waves of fear 
Oceans rise and rage as we watch the world powers fall 
Redeeming their sinful ways with their souls 
May the truth fill their hearts, let them see the light, when they embrace their gods "והנה חרבו פני האדמה..... שופך דם האדם ואדם דמו ישפך..." 
Seas cover the works of timeless art 
That once brought joy to human hearts 
In halls of infamy this day shall live 
Like the burning of rome and betrayal of 
Eve Like the fire raised at the witches' stakes 
Return all earthly possessions 
As ashes you return to earth, child of 
God, to face the divine lord who sits upon the throne - eyes sad 
Go in peace and thy faith 
Evolve thy self and lose all hate 
So a heaven you may create 
In this world of sorrowful ways 
None shall live to see the light of day 
Some may survive to tell this tale 
If their belief shall conquer this gale 
Damnation is the punishment bestowed 
El Norra Alila the vengeful 
GodOne life to live to pay your daily fee
The labor for your love weighted with hours that never cease
They will tell you that you'll never make it
Corruption lies within
never bow to forty thousand feet
We will survive
This is the only way we will make it out alive
We will survive
Unless you persevere you'll be left to rot behind
Two deaths to die everything is closing in
Still pushing forward now
you're standing on the edge
They still tell you that you'll never make it
The avaricious won't amend
you will be carried safely in the end
We will survive
This is the only way
we will make it out alive
We will survive
Unless you persevere you'll be left to rot behind
The slaving wager leads men to more than war
Mother****ing bounce
This is my survival
We will survive
We will survive
We will survive
We will survive.
I've got my life laid out in front
of me like roads drawn on the map.
I've had so many times where I slipped off the beaten path.
I took the time to see the picture in for what it's worth.
I'd walk a thousand miles without my shoes to make it work.
.
I swore to God that I'm never coming back.
Kept my faith when I was clacked.
Staring at the wall through a crack in the floor.
And these metal doors, they've got me trapped.
I gotta remind myself
that my mind is strong so I won't lose my head.
I've got my demons that I fight with,
every little thought in every breath.
.
I wear my heart up on my sleeve so my soul's exposed.
And I carry this disease, the weight of the holy ghost.
God, can you hear me? God is missing.
.
Take it back, take it back, my friend,
All the things that you said about the end.
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over.
Give it up, give it up, my friend.
The score is settled even if you won't admit.
Set it down, final hour without a doubt, it's over when it's over.
.
You've got your life laid out in front of you, like a car crash.
I'm cautious at the wheel cause you were driving too fast.
But if you took the time to check up in your rearview mirror,
You'd see the things you're driving from are your biggest fears.
.
You gotta get back up from the wreckage above
and walk right through the fire.
No matter what happens, the fact is
that the flames keep getting higher.
You gotta keep it going,
keep tiptoeing through the fire
and the flames and the pain of knowing.
Through all this doubt, gotta keep on going,
Gotta give that spark, gotta keep on glowing.
.
I wear my heart up on my sleeve so my soul's exposed.
And I carry this disease, the weight of the holy ghost.
God, can you hear me? God is missing.
.
Take it back, take it back, my friend,
All the things that you said about the end.
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over.
Give it up, give it up, my friend.
The score is settled even if you won't admit.
Set it down, final hour without a doubt, it's over when it's over.
.
So please, please, just let me make my peace.
I refuse to let your words be the death of me.
Please, please, just let me live my life.
Stop living in my shadow and just make it right.
It's over, make it right.
.
Take it back, take it back, my friend,
All the things that you said about the end.
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over.
Give it up, give it up, my friend.
The score is settled even if you won't admit.
Set it down, final hour without a doubt, it's over when it's over.
It's over, it's over.
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over.无歌词Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
I won't give in
Shan Xiaohan
If my heart could sing, would you stay?
Would you stay and listen?
Would you stay and listen?
If my soul was torn, would you help?
Would you try and fix me?
Would you help un-break me?
Your smile, it eats me alive
And I can't turn away any longer
Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
I won't give in
Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
I won't give in
I'm a ghost of what's left of me
Begging you to hear me
Can you even feel me?
I can't let you go, save me please
Will you stay here with me?
Will you ever leave me?
Your smile it eats me alive
And I can't turn away any longer
Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
I won't give in
Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
I won't give in
I gave you everything
I never thought we would end up like this
I gave you everything
I can't let you go, save me please
I gave you everything
(I won't give in)
I gave you everything
(I won't give in)
Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
(I'll be your light in the darkness)
Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
I won't give in
Every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You're slowly killing yourself
I won't give in
I gave you everything
I never thought we would end up like thisI am broken by my birthright
And made to die by design
I was put on this earth to fail you
Why do you put your faith in me?
I will let you down
I will give you a reason to hate me
I will give you a reason to despise me
I never thought I'd see the day
When I'd see my maker face to face
Every sin accounted for
Every bad decision I ever made
Little did I know this would all lead up to this
This is my time
This is my breaking point
I'll pay my price
Just please don't let me miss
My peace of mind
I'll even die for this
God ease my soul
And don't let me forget
That there is nothing forcing me to a bitter end
I can't stand another day in my head
All the pain
All the lies
It's wearing me thin
Why can't I just follow you?
Oh God, it's taking over
This is a takeover
My eyes have learned to lust
And my mind was molded to betray you
I've let this spite fill my lungs
Fill my lungs
This is my breaking point
This is my breaking point
This will not be my bitter end
I'll pay my price
Just please don't let me miss
My peace of mind
I'll even die for this
God ease my soul
And don't let me forget
That there is nothing forcing me to a bitter end
I'll pay my price
Just please don't let me miss
My peace of mind
I'll even die for this
God ease my soul
And don't let me forget
That there is nothing forcing me to a bitter end
Bitter end
Bitter end
This is my breaking point无歌词作词 : Alexi Laiho
The faint blaze of the candle of my life,
slowly dying like a fire in a pouring rain.
No sparks of hope inside,
no shooting stars on my sky.
On broken wings, no flying high...

Another night, another demise,
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice...
I`ll let the wind blow out the light
cuz its gets more painful every time I die.

Out of strenght to fight.
I cannot take another night.
I cannot take it no more.
Lust of light slips through my fingers
like blood on my arms.
Black candle wax has buried me...

Another night, another demise,
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice...
I`ll let the wind blow out the light
cuz its gets more painful every time I die.Old prophet's land
A battlefield of non-believers in a violent rage
A declaration of human rights a pretext
For maintenance of a new world order
Above all written laws a growth concept
Created by the patriot of the civilized world
Rearmament
Welfare state
Disarmament
Non-member state
Free market economy a consequence of military needs
Loss of lives
Human rights activists political pawn in a game
Nothing can they do without state subsidies
A gift of today`s world
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us!
Production at any price
Admiration of those who earn
With blood on their hands
We will never learn
A gift of today`s world
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us!
 作曲 : Antti Kokko
 作词 : Pekka KokkoTearing down the walls I have painted with blood flowing down for eternity
Sliding on the surface of your luscious soul I'm selling dreams for nothing

You're welcome to my private freakshow

Split the soul, crash and burn and back to the wall I don't need a reason
Give you all despicables a brand new god I'm going down in a treason

I'm calling your name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me
I'm calling your name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me

Crystallize all the emotions burning upon the stake of my memories
All I wanted all I needed is so ****in' lost

I'm calling your name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me
I'm calling your name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me

I feel your breath on me

And slowly blood is flowing off me I'm dying only to revive

In this perdition haze I have lost my soul
In this perdition haze you're not alone

In this perdition haze I have lost my soul
In this perdition haze you're not alone

Going nowhere still there's nowhere to run in this hell I'm raising
Keeping my soul clear from the monsters that breathe beyond the dark I'm feeding

Split the soul, crash and burn and back to the wall I don't need a reason
Give you all despicables a brand new god forever lost in a treason

I'm calling your name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me

I'm calling your name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me无歌词Mama says I'm not good at anything
Keep my mouth shut, say nothing
Not venting my thoughts, just sit and waste
like a living ghost, cause I feel misplaced

I want my dream
but it feels so far away
I want to be on the cover of magazines
I want to be on MTV or have my own reality

I wish they would break down the walls to get to me
Isn't this so ****ing insane?
The world behind the box is taking over my brain

Mama says I'm not good at anything
I stare at emptiness and say nothing

Don't open my mouth, just sit and waste

Like a living ghost, cause I feel misplaced

I hate seeing all this shit
but at the same time I want to be a part of it
"Suicide!" Repeats itself in my mind
I wish they would break down the walls to get to me

Isn't this so ****ing insane?
The world behind the box is taking over my brain无歌词Far away, where the sunshine never fades
There lies this land, the greatest of tales
(interlude)
A strong golden gate now slowly moves aside
In walks a man, exhausted by the tide
Finally, I've reached my destiny
I've crossed the western sea for the land of hope an glory
In front of me stands the glorious grand city
A feeling that I can breathe, and be free
Surrounding golden walls, finest marble covers the halls
Silver-plated streets that glimmer and shine
Statues, monuments and fountains filled with wine
And trees nearly touching the sky
In the land of hope and glory
(interlude)
I head to the greatest hall,
take a deep breath and open the door
Is this the land of hope and glory?
Sitting on a golden throne,
an ape holding a scepter of bone
It utters: "The die is cast."

(interlude)
Echoes from the homeland

Kotimaan rannat kutsuu poikaa Pohjolan
Hoist the sails, it's time to leave these lands behind
Rain or hail won't stop me, I have made up my mind
Surrounded by dark emptiness
The sea is cold and merciless
All alone, I'm heading home
Over the vast sea, wide and so deep
Ahti I greet thee, I'm heading home!
The wind is rising, cold and biting
Ilmarinen I greet thee
Northern shores - I'm home
(interlude)
No surrounding golden walls, no marble covered halls
No silver-plated streets that glimmer and shine
No statues, monuments nor fountains filled with wine
Only trees touching the sky
(interlude)
Far away, where sunshine never fadesIgnite my veins with your blood to inspire new verses
I'm drained to my dregs
Replace my eyes with your fire to burn through the curses
Leave nothing that could hinder your blinding light
Test me in the furnace of affliction
Refine me as you wish
When the die is cast
Breathe in me your animating spark
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So take me now
It's not my blood to bleed
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So I cry out:
The last word is yours to speak
Sharpen my tongue with precision only your words convey
I've kept waiting too long
Breathe in my lungs a passion that strangles corruption
Till there's nothing left
Fleshkiller
We're engraved on your hand
Fleshkiller
We're engraved on your hand
Test me in the furnace of affliction
Refine me as you wish
When the die is cast
Breathe in me your animating spark
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So take me now
It's not my blood to bleed
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So I cry out:
The last word is yours to speak
Fleshkiller
Disease has no grasp on your reign
Fleshkiller
Prison cells won't contain your light
With every crushing blow
we are engraved upon your hand
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So take me now
It's not my blood to bleed
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So I cry out:
The last word is yours to speakYou're tied down, you're locked up
You've got no way out
You're broke down you're fed up
Your lungs start to shout
You're wincing, convulsing
You're aching with pain
Gasping for breath, and you're feeling insane
Hole after hole
Just proving your point
Point after point
Just digging you hole
Slow digging with a spoon
Hooked!
You're hooked on a drug that's controlling your mind
Hocking your soul for that measly last dime
You're dragged off and thrown in your own padded cell
You've reached end of rope at bottom of well
Yellow-black arm-hole of eager junk acceptance
Thin steel prick cums in your arm
I see you fall over and over again
Hanging onto nothing you thought was a friendJudge me for what I am
The passage of death
You don't play, you don't win
You change nothing
You gain nothing
Everybody's out from here on in
Heed my words hear me calling
Citizens watch
They're stealing our freedom
Promises left to die
And long forgotten
The government's lost
Tantamount to treason
Tedious the way we fall in
Avenging the cause
A rebel with reason
Fallen lines
Yet war keeps calling more home
I've been forsaken
For I am a patriot
Judge me for what I am
The passage of death
You don't play, you don't win
You change nothing
You gain nothing
Everybody's out from here on in
Need my trust
To tie the blindfold
Bled for my nation saluted the flag
Seeds of hate
Beneath numbered tombstones
Crowding more
Pledge my allegiance in ruins and rags
Heed my words hear me calling
Bled for my nation saluted the flag
Promises left to die
And long forgotten
Pledge my allegiance in ruins and rags
Out of my mind so easily
I've left behind so many dreams
Judge me for what I am
The passage of death
You don't play, you don't win
You change nothing
You gain nothing
Everybody's out from here on in
Heed my words hear me calling
Citizens watch
They're stealing our freedom
Promises left to die
And long forgotten
The government's lost
Tantamount to treason
Tedious the way we fall in
Avenging the cause
A rebel with reason
Fallen lines
As war keeps calling more home
I've been forsaken
For I am a patriot
Out of my mind so easily
I've left behind so many dreams
Spiritual blindness poisons me
Not living on living on my knees
Out of my mind so easily
I've left behind so many dreams
Spiritual blindness poisons me
Not living on or dying on my knees作曲 : Sammet
I'm just a loser in the game of love
I'm just a stray boy in the shade
And how I Wish to know what love is like
To find someone to contemplate
There's a voice and a million answers
To the questions I don't ask a demon-I've got to contain
When I'm walking through the fen
Gonna deep into the black
There are whispers that I can't restrain
Don't give in
Rise to fame
Time will come
Make your claim
Time has come
For the crow who fly away
So you're an angel meant to walk down here
And you believe it's all divine
And you don't play by all those temporal rules
Watch the world begin to die
Alright-when the lamb's been torn to pieces,
I've been crashing from the sky
Fallen to care for the pray
They put a spoke right in your wheel
I'm the one to dare the weak
To push you all over the pain
You give in
Oh...
Rise to fame
Time will come
Make your claim
Time has come
For the crow who fly away
I close my eyes and I see what's coming my way
He's got treasure in his eyes that he gonna turn to clay
Hm,I'm a stranger
I'm a changer and I'm a danger
Maybe...
Fallen angel-waiting for the prey
The devil has come to take a mainmed away
Penetration of the twisted mind
The evil is out for the weak and blind
I can feel it in your voice
Ever so sweet
No
Do I really have a choice?
No,no,no!
Oh,you burn your feet n unholy ground
You roam the barren wicked plains abound
In evil eyes and evil speak
About it all your evil freaks
When you say it's all divine and meant to be
What about your flesh and blood and defire like me?
Their evil eyes are looking down on you
And those who don't are losing sight of you
Face the rage to chase away
The specter of disgrace and shame
Withered roses dying on the ledge
A withered dreamer standing on the edge
You dream of love but you wake up to pain
You're better off to join in my game
Then she'll better off to cry contrite tears
One day she'll wonder why she had to let you disappear
Rise to fame
(your time has come)
Time will come
(to take the sun)
Make your claim-you're drawn to the sound
Time has come-you're leaving ground
Rise to fame-the flight of the crow
Time will come-cross the line
Your time has come
For the crow to fly away
It's a flight to hell
Can you hear the bell
The devil has come
To take your soul away
A flight to hell
Alright
I'm a stranger
I'm a changer
And I'm danger
Fallen angel
Waiting for the preyBaby, put down the drink
And baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And when you're down on your knees, it's so hard to swallow
Your heart is beatin' like a loaded gun
What's done is done and you're spinnin' in circles
Where's the girl that I used to know?
Why did you let her go? You know I loved her so
It's never any more than one for me
But always two or three for you
Baby, put down the drink
Baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And when you're down on your knees, it's so hard to swallow
I don't want to see it go this way
Feelin' like tomorrow is just a yesterday
I hate the way it is and to tell you the truth
It's killin' me and it's killin' you
I can't stand all the ups and downs
The back and forths and the 'round and 'rounds
The in and outs of the slammin' doors
It's tearin' me apart, I can't take no more
It's never any more than one for me
But always two or three for you
Baby, put down the drink
Baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And when you're down on your knees, yeah, it's so hard to swallow
I want us back like we were before
Not like the broken glass lyin' on the floor
Baby, put down the drink
(Put down the drink)
Baby, put down the bottle
(Put down the bottle)
It feels like it's all slippin' away
I wish I had you like it has you
It feels like it's all slippin' away
I wish I had you
Baby, put down the drink
Baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And you get high when you're down, but I'm watchin' you fall
So baby, put down the drink
Baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And when you're down on your knees, yeah, it's so hard to swallow
I want us back like we were before
Not like the broken glass lyin' on the floor
Baby, put down the drink
Put down the bottle
(When you're down on your knees, it's so hard to swallow)
Put down the drink
Put down the bottle
Your heart is beatin' like a loaded gun
What's done is done
And you're spinning in circlesSometimes You're The Hammer, Sometimes You're The Nail

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me.
Take it away from me.
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling.
Go get carried away.

GO!

And the fears sets in, in an instant.
Too much of myself gets exposed.
This is where I go at my weakest,
When I don't have to be scared to tell the truth.

Tend to do my best when everything goes wrong.
That's why sad songs make me happy,
'cause I don't have to feel alone.

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me.
Take it away from me.
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling.
No, you've got me wrong.
Oh the nights are long with no one else around.
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me.
Go get carried away.

It's never what you've done, it's what you've done lately.
Who cares what you're saying, if no ones listening.
You don't have to like me, but you're gonna respect me.
I that came from nothing, leave hope in my wake.

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt.
To those left in sadness I'll be the one to lead you out.

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me.
Take it away from me.
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling.
No, you've got me wrong.
Oh the nights are long with no one else around.
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me.
Go get carried away.

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve my right to be afraid.
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way.
I want to be a better person. I wanna know the master plan.
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don't make me who I am.
I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve my right to be afraid.
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way.
I want to be a better person. I wanna know the master plan.
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don't make me who I am.

God help those who help themselves, and forget about everyone else.
You lost your nerve, you missed the point.

God help those with open hands, may they never feel burden again.
Yeah I'll stand up for those who can't.
I'll close the distance.无歌词无歌词
