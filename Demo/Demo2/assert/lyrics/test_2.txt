Black Tears
When I'm in this state of mind 
 I'm wishing I am blind
 Sometimes life is more than pain to me
 I feel the power of my grief
 Death would be such a relief
 All the secrets that I hide 
 Would die with me
 
 Depression is my only friend
 Will this torture never end?
 Let me carry on to the dreamers' sky
 I keep crying in my dreams 
 Can you hear my endless screams?
 When I fade away I fade, away
 
 Life is just a masquerade 
 In dept to myself but I can't pay
 Soon I'll call it all a day, away
 I've never felt what you call guilt
 I still believe "do what thou wilt"
 My sorrow will destroy the world I've built
 
 This fluid on my cheek
 It drains me, I get weak
 My heart is cold and bleak 
 Black blood, black tears

Aurora Borealis
byLiuuzaki

Under a darkened sun, they are born
When the moon is losing its shape
I'm here again to see
Nightly dance of the flames

Once my father bore his sword
To defend the clan till the end
Now he braves the battles
Between red northern flames

In the silence of night
I stare at those ancient lights
Which enlighten the way from the cradle
And lead warriors in grave
They have always been
And they will never change
They light the fire of soul
And keep it burning bright

And behind the scattered clouds
Star field of the sky
Brings back the dreams I already lost

Shall I ever be like him?
Brave warrior of night
Whose name will be
Written on the northern lights

In the silence of night
I stare at those ancient lights
Which enlighten the way from the cradle
And lead warriors in grave
They have always been
And they will never change
They light the fire of soul
And keep it burning bright

Prophetion
A gap between the scenes
Severs the present and the time to come
On the layers of the outer heaven
Hidden omens are found
The one who seeks
May find the end of the line
But the one who also sees
Makes out the meaning of the signs
The brightest star is dying
The forgotten becomes the light
After the seventh circle is complete
Red sand will cover the ground
When the third man arrives
Red blood tames the hate
Gold turns into iron
Into the blade of the tyrant's fate
To the sign of the Raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tide to time
The eyes of the Viper lead
Me through the darkest woods
Under the wings of the Phoenix
I land onto the nest of the truth
To the sign of the Raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tide to time
The eyes of the Viper lead
Me through the darkest woods
Under the wings of the Phoenix
I land onto the nest of the truth
To the sign of the Raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision

Heart  Of  Wilderness
Eternal  Tears  Of  Sorrow
The  night's  too  strong
The  light's  so  weak
This  is  where  it  all  began
It's  all  the  same  once  more
The  times  are  so  dark
They  reach  the  end
The  ancient  omens  are  now  here
The  golden  beast  is  free
It's  free!
I  seek  to  find
The  lost  piece  of  time
Is  the  dream  the  hidden  truth
Or  just  a  shadow  of  the  past?
I  fear  to  lose  all  that  I  have
I'm  a  prisoner  of  my  own  thought
And  I  can't  find  the  way  out
I  look  between  the  stars
I  breathe  between  the  dreams
I'm  just  the  messenger  of  the  truth
The  distant  voice  in  the  dark
I  see  a  falling  star
Which  makes  my  dreams  come  true
Could  it  be  that  now  we  have
All  the  time  in  the  heart  of  the  wilderness?
Music```
Wind  through  the  fire
Light  through  the  dark
Now  it's  the  time  to  build  something  new
And  break  the  wall  of  lies
The  ruins  of  town  I  left  behind
It's  the  time  to  choose  a  brand  new  path
And  face  the  myths  of  life
I  look  between  the  stars
I  breathe  between  the  dreams
I'm  just  the  messenger  of  the  truth
The  distant  voice  in  the  dark
I  see  a  falling  star
Which  makes  my  dreams  come  true
Could  it  be  that  now  we  have
All  the  time  in  the  heart  of  the  wilderness?

Mirror Of Sins
by自闭式怀旧
How did I fall？
How did I come to this ?
I have thought past was a past
Now I'm taking a look into the glass
Searching for a light
some kind of my delight
Which I can't find !
Now I can see myself
In the mirror of my sins !
Wind recalls my deeds
An abstract of my life
All is spoiled and destroyed
Now I see what I have done !
As I stand here, I'm living dead
My heart is black and soul is fading
Is it real ?
Or is it sum of all my fears ?
Now I'm taking a look into the glass
Searching for a light
some kind of my delight
Which I can't find !
Now I can see myself
In the mirror of my sins !
In the mirror In the mirror In the mirror of my sins

Light cloaks, shinning steel
Heavy armour, lethal swords
Mighty spirits, greedy souls
A white horse, carrying it all
Killing in the name of the god
Burn it into ashes and dust
Steal all gold in the power of the cross
Take all land, covert all souls
Killing in the name of the god
Burn it into ashes and dust
Steal all gold in the power of the cross
Take all land, covert all souls
They have their reason to take it all
To fatten up the holy church
They give to god - blood stained gold
Poor souls, no spirit at all
Castles and convents with mighty doors
Crimson drapes and thrones of oak
Halls of brave, glory and faith
Blessed by the god we raid again
They have their reason to take it all
To fatten up the holy church
They give to god - blood stained gold
Poor souls, no spirit at all

Virgin Soil
by梦庞统
Behold, he stands before you all
Upon the tower, fit to fall
See the beauty of the never-ending
Hear his creatures call
Say then, say then
Lay no eye upon my eye, lay no voice upon my crying
Set no truth above my lie, shed no tear upon my dying
An orphan is your child to be
And like you took my child from me
The likes of this, my vengeance
Jave my hell bred creatures yet to see
I've never known such naked pain
As if I'm naked in the rain
I've searched each world for virgin soil
Fit for my slaughtered child's remains

Say then, say then
For an eye you take an eye, take my voice for all your crying
Upon your infants grave I lie, upon it's death I do my dying
For his eye you take an eye, shattered was he when we found him
Stone and cut and crucify, leave his killer's heart unpounding
Men and angels hide in vain
For he who hath my firstborn slain
Shall die before the sun has set
He took my child, he will regret

Say then, say then
Lay no eye upon my eye, lay no voice upon my crying
Set no truth above my lie, shed no tear upon my dying

Poised the strike in the slumberous sword
Of the dark and childless lord
"This machete of mine will get thee in time “
We're alone in a room with no door"
Yes, I recall the death of one
Older and more holy son
I see the irony, but that won't render
This one deed undone
Say then, say then
For his eye you paid an eye, a law you find is self-fulfilling
In your place your child did die
Death is all you gain from killing
Death is all you gain from killing
Death is all you gain from killing

Temporary Borders

tiTemporary Borders
arIllnath
alCast Into Fields Of Evil Pleasure
Whispered words beneath the floating autumn leaves
Flying softly on the southern breeze
Fragments of light between the branches and trees
I wish I would stay here forever
The sun is sinking behind mountains of old
Brushing faintly clouds of red and gold
Night-time's flinging a vast veil of velvet across fields and forest
Trespassing the havens of daylight's temporary borders
I knew my game could gain me but grief, the fairy tale was on though brief
Trespassing the havens of secrecy's temporary borders
Scratching the surface of times seemingly forgotten
Of you who once were mine betrothen
Digging 'neath layers of emotions now rotten
I feel myself slip away
Nostalgic entertainment tingled by the past
You were the one to be mine at last
But now my memory's ever fading so fast
Keeping emotions at bay
Here I sit, and memories unfold
My feelings are hollow,
I'm feeling so old
"I feel it fade away and cry tears in solitude"
Trespassing the havens of night-time's temporary borders
As shadows collapse in the mating of day and night, crows are circling in ominous flight
Trespassing the havens of my own temporary borders (temporary borders)
I tried
I tried hard to believe
Thinking of us has left me but grief
I cannot look ahead, the past is all
I see Moments together, but time's a thief
Shadows recurring from times long since passed
Our time and now in a perfect contrast
 "As I see you sitting by my grave I feel your presence,
but can't say a word Your heart and love,
patient and brave But my soul is too late for you to save"
I am probably a fool still thinking of you
Night after night
There's not much else
I can do For neither myself nor you
Maybe I should leave and never come back to this place
But I know too surely that
I'm only fooling myself
I'm only fooling myself

Hight above yer shadow smiles at me
Way down below I hear your serenely breathe
I'm running after you throughout
the valleys of tormented souls,
don't you be afraid of me only kissing your shadows
You're so far away, I can your scent,
when I carries your shadow,
and if you truly want I'll cross the line I'll follow
I'm dreaming my way out from down below
To get wherever you haunting from, I'll go
I'm kissing the shadows you surround me with,
to feel my pain vanishing away from me
Your touching the shadows I'm surrounding you with,
so together in pease we shall be
I'm running after you throughout
the valleys of tormented souls,
don't you be afraid of me only kissing your shadows
You're so far away, I can your scent,
when I carries your shadow,
and if you truly want I'll cross the line I'll follow

Breaking loose
From reality surrounding me
Keeping you
Bonded in my imagination
Drifting away
Within the limits of consciousness
Falling in sleep
With memories you left for me

Throwing all away
Meaningless words
Nothing left
Inside me

Restless dream
Stiring up in my head
Shakes up
My sweaty body from torture
Waking up
In empty room filled with dark
Asking myself
Will this reality never end?

Where are you
My wealth of life?
Vanity filling my mind
Hole in me in distress
Who will fill up
My Hollow Heart?

AblumThey Will Return 

Throwing all away
Meaningless words
Nothing left
Inside me
Please god
Never let me fall asleep
Make me real
Keep away from my imagination
Dishearten mind
Still looking for another answer
Hopeless act
Action speak louder than words

Where are you
My wealth of life?
Vanity filling my mind
Hole in me in distress
Who will fill up
My Hollow Heart?

Who will fill up

The Trapper
In the eyes of the trapper fire's burning, burning bright
He's searching for the crossing where the fox has left its traces on
Shortly finds a trail jam, lays his snare under the trace
With care wipes his own marks and skis back along his own tracks

The work has been done as well as he does
Can't sleep at night, can't stand the wait
He has to get up, he has to leave
And before the dawn the chase is on

Gently slide the skis on the hardened skiing tracks
The narrow beam of the headlight moves around back and forth
Shows the way through the tangle, reveals the gleam under the spruce
The yellow flashes in the darkness, shotgun's flame lights up the sky

The gleam dies out
But the fire's burning

And on the gambrel's nails
Is hanging upside down
One of god's cereals
Giving away its skin and tail

Once and again
This lonely man
Is skiing back
Along his own tracks

Dark thoughts rise up
Deep in your mind
The killing of hope
The end has begun
The locked psycho-door breaks down
The beast breathes freedom and fire
Blows bloody thoughts into your mind

Demons whisper ＂COMMIT SUICIDE!＂

Weak is your body,
Helpless your soul,

The beast destroyed your will

Left nothing but an empty shell

Self-destruction leads its way
Your weapons turn against yourself
Cutting through, killing you
A downward spiral, the shadowbeast has won

The shadowbeast calls
A vulture of life

Your worst enemy dwells

Rain, come down on me - nightfall, won't you just set me free?

Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go

Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows

Life, it ends tonight - breaking the chains of eternity
Life, it ends tonight - set me free
What should I know? What should I do to get rid of you?
Your life to me equals nothing

I never had a past, the present is a lie and now I know my future is dead

Life, it ends tonight - set me free
Rain, come down on me - nightfall, won't you just set me free?

The light that blinds Reflex the fear that I have no time
I watch the leaves
I see the glance shining icy bright
The day has come
I step outside facing darker side
Warmth keeps fading
Frost is cutting
Air I'm breathing
Death cold feeling
Now I see the hordes are coming
I'm still living!
Face of the Winterking
White frost on the fields
Creeps into the souls
Force of the Winterreal
Across the clear blue sky
The reign of snow will rise
Battle begins
Our Blades are sharp and against the foe
We march out
Mellow men fight against time
The field is lost
Save your souls from the Winterking
Leave this place
Cause your damned and you fight in vain

Afraid of dying reckless
Golden light admired
The King's sword is grazing me
Remorsefulness desired
He covers the skies
Looks out the sun brings us endless nights
The ruler of ice
Collects the souls of the fallen knights
The fields is lost
Save tour souls from the Winterking
Leave this place
Cause your damned and you fight in vain

But I didn't know myself
Didn't see the things hidden
In my hollowness
Didn't peep round the curtain
Of your exterior
And the crack turned into an edge
That opens between
Listen to the wind singing in the grass,My love
As you lay yourself down to rest
Listen to the cry of the river in autumn cold,My dear
Before I close the gates deep down inside
You were
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
Those secrets that I revealed
Buried in icy bosom
Those words that I've spoken
Taken by the dawn
The strings that were connected
Separated parts left
Read are the rhymes of story
Of the endless poet
Listen to the wind,singing in the grass,My love
As you lay yourself down to rest
Listen to the cry of the river In autumn cold,My dear
Before I close the gates deep down inside
You were
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights

Enchained us, tore away our pride
No will to resist, no will to exist
Experimenting with these newly born
A little game with the insane
Rolling back the time for centuries
Make us live and die like our fathers

Harvest the damned, reap the bleak
Bring here for us to bear
Enchanted simplicity
For a mind, so blind, so open to find
This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger
This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger

Inner peace, enchains me
Entities fall off from the timeline
Burning will, storms there still, suffocated thrill
Subconscious ravishment

The Blind Leader
作曲  Kokko, Kokko, Kokko
  A man -highest in rank
 Always commands
 Obeys the will
 Of the mighty word
 
 Wealth is all he wants to reach
 Don' t give a damn to our land
 
 Chorus
 He cannot see what is happening in our world
 Our system falls by his hand
 Conqueror' s end
 
 
 With toxic waste master creates
 Catastrophies that lead to the end
 
 A biowar man never can win
 Technology his only reward
 
 Chorus
 
 Twisted creation of mankind

New World Shadows
Fallen we see
The memories echoing here
And the days
How they long to be
Forgotten
You are programmed not to play
But to die
Blind
How beautiful today
It is raining again
And there is no need
To wait for the end
Come and see
As the shadows dance
To tame a land

We walk this earth
With fire in our hands
Eye for an eye
We are nemesis
We are with you
Countless vicious souls
Fight,fighting for freedom
United,we stand

We are a legion
Voice of anarchy
This is revolution!
Creating new disorder
We are enemy
opponent of the system
Crushing hypocrisy
slaying the philistine
One for all
All for one
We are strong
We are one
One for all
All for one
We are one
Nemesis
A malicious fever burns
In our heart,in our veins

Reflections
Those nightly whispers
I hear the rain again,
this world is sleeping
From darkness comes forever beauty

Awake all alone
memories are lost
like tears in the rain
My shattered soul has fallen down

When night is turning to the dawn
I don't want to be alone
my blackened faith is broken
I watch reflections of my life

Like a ghost I am
I stare into the darkess
my thoughts are fateful
they break me down and make me see the dark

Waiting for a dream
Those ghosts come again
in darkness and the rain
my shattered soul has fallen down again

When night is turning to the dawn
I don't want to be alone
my blackened faith is broken
I watch reflections of my life

When night is turning to the dawn
I don't want to be alone
my blackened faith is broken
I watch reflections of my life

Hold the Sword
byLiuuzaki
Behold the signs of the never-ending war,
the furious screams of the gods
As the nightfall sets to the distance,
the blood of the warriors light the sky
This moment is ready to be ruined,
by those who dishonor the blade
As he looks into their eyes he sees fear;
the bleeding wounds are no excuse
No Excuse!
Even those who lead the way,
show fear in their hearts
Time has come for the One to rise
to show where courage is, when it can't be found
The birth of the child of war,
the one who will define the way,
for those who shall be carrying the blade till the end of days
Fate only smiles to the wise,
who put themselves aside
Who are ready to die, embrace the form
of honor in its purest form,
the honor of dying,
as you're holding the sword
Fight!
Like the last man in the night,
holding the front alone, and the
Fear!
Shall be no more if the one's prepared
to hold the sword
Hold the sword!
Fight!
Like the last man in the night,
holding the front alone, and the
Fear!
Shall be no more if the one's prepared
to hold the sword
Hold the sword!
Tales shall be written in his honor,
his cause will define a man
The strongest of all will bow to him, the child of the god of war

 作曲  Mäenpää
For years I have travelled in coldness,
but my heart is warm as the darkened sun above me
Nothing can ever take away
what I've seen with these tired eyes
Face of the weeping night
and the shade of the fading light
Face of the weeping night
The dawn will never rise again for my eyes
and I will never sleep again
I've lost my hope time after time
cause the light has vanished from the sky
Now when the darkness has become part of me
I got to let my shadows free
cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
something that could have made me one
Now when the sorrow has taken control of me
I got to let my shadows free
cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
something that could have made me one
something that I could reach the Sun

True freedom deep within, this agony is not a sin
Inside these walls I'm captured in
Blood dripping through my eyes, my life carries so many lies

Make me feel like I was born to die
If you hear my voice screaming out loud
Please come save me before it's too late

Rasputin
There lived a certain man in Russia, long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame, how he carried on
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen, he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed, he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son
repeat
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
For power became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about
This outrageous man became louder and louder
"This man's just got to go", declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night, some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us", they kept demanding
And he really came
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and said, "I feel fine"
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra-Ra-Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead
Oh, those Russians

This is where I want to be
I have made it here from nothing

Theres yet extermination, inside us all screaming

Wary steps of drawing near, decisive silence, restless breath
Would-be angelhood, sucking out lifeblood drop by drop
I feel your hand on me Your touch is wrong
Blood on your arms You won't see till bury with your own hands
Blood in your mouth Tasted once you'll have no strength to stop
Chokehold! Warm flow you drink in wastes me It's easier
To scramble out of the grave than to tear myself from your embrace
There's no way to hide from you, there's no sense to run away
You retrieve me to the place where steps of hopelessness begin Just make me dead
Spit blood
I feel your skin, I feel your hand on me Touching to kiss
It's not like you're gonna care
You drown in my blood your tears and sorrow You want more and more Are you not blood drunk yet?
Give me your hand to show you my pain somewhere Give me one more chance to die Take me out!
Let carry out my desire, just mortify Leave me alone forever! 
My desire, I let you kill Leave me alone forever!
Red drips, warm sweet blood streams you drink I feel cold kiss, taste of bloodred lips
Chokehold, dead set to belong to you I suffocate and you breathe
Goodbye, I gasp out to you It's the time for death kiss
I feel your skin, I feel your hand on me Touching to kiss
It's not like you're gonna care
You drown in my blood your tears and sorrow You want more and more Are you not blood drunk yet?
Give me your hand to show you my pain somewhere Give me one more chance to die Take me out!
Let carry out my desire, just mortify Leave me alone forever!

There is a net under the ice
With a thousand knots tied
And unchecked amount of slime
Hanging down
There is a burbot on the net
Into the mesh he has put his head
Now struggling for his life
Entangling more and more
And there is a fisherman on the ice
Drilling a hole with sweat and blood
Trying to draw the net above
The icy surface
But even though how hard he pulls
The net won't budge
Under the ice the net has stuck
With thousand knots into the ground
With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength
But with his latest wrench
The net will tear to shreds

Burn
The fire will light the path
Trade for the nightfall
The pattern is so predictable
Another reason to dream in the moment
Not be denied
I'm not a product of circumstance
Or a name in a line

Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
It's this sheltered life that you're living
Try to recognise
Your choked up words
Are empty still
Fight Blood in the throne room
It's over
These towers fall
Blood in the throne room
It's over
This towers fall
Your lies
Pull me down
Same old lies

Fear is the change
That brings you down
Blood in the throne room
It's over, it's over
Mirror my lesson learned
Tailored for reason
Laid to rest your lies

We were together as one
All that we had can't be undone
Our love fading, now it's gone
Our time fading, so it's done

The blood that binds us

Alone we die, my Frozen Angel
Alone we fade away from this world
Alone you die, my frozen Angel
Alone you fade away, from - this - world!

All that we had can't be undone

Monochromatic Stains
 作词  Brändström, Jivarp, Stanne
There  is  this  face  in  the  still  water
I  can't  remember  ever  wearing
Like  fingerprints  on  your  heart
Reading  out  the  last  lines  of  code
To  the  untrained  eye  a  secret
I  bled  away  the  last  of  you
Sought  trust  in  shapes  of  combined  results
That  trickles  from  a  less  than  solid  case
Fought  off  attacks  of  resurfaced  lust
Burn  the  gracing  grounds
What  will  give  in  first
The  body  or  the  lash
Monochromatic  stains
Who  will  cave  in  first
The  leader  or  the  fake
Monochromatic  stains
This  pile  of  ashes  of  a  soul
Informant  pokes  abound
These  sickly  little  fingers
Get  away  from  me
Tread  not  the  path  of  least  restraint
Each  piece  of  evidence  a  lie,a  lie
The  body,the  face  all  items  in  place
I  don't  remember  a  thing
What  will  give  in  first
The  body  or  the  lash
Monochromatic  stains
Who  will  cave  in  first
The  leader  or  the  fake
A  sacrifice  made  to  the  loss  of  mind
Folly  a  man's  demise
Track  now  the  stains  that  allow  my  fall
Sickening,the  sight  of  it  all
Never  shall  I  claim  my  innocence
I  just  was  not  there
What  will  give  in  first
The  body  or  the  lash
Monochromatic  stains
Who  will  cave  in  first
The  leader  or  the  fake

The Sleeping Beauty
byLiuuzaki
I cannot close my eyes
I'm watching sleeping beauty
The world without the fear,
the world without the pain

Tonight there are no tears, no cry
Tonight there are no painted smiles
Tonight

There is a ghost on the sun
When night has fallen on the ground
Angels are dancing on the sky
I'm watching sleeping beauty

Tonight your voice is calling again
Everything is so perfect, you are here tonight
I buried you deep in my heart
and now our fate becomes one

There is a ghost on the sun
When night has fallen on the ground
Angels are dancing on the sky
I'm watching sleeping beauty

There is a ghost on the sun
When night has fallen on the ground
Angels are dancing on the sky

Under the starlight skies
I watch her snow white face
On sleeping leaves my angel's tears
Shine light that's quiet and cold
In beautiful darkness
Birds of death sing in the end
All these memories will be lost
All these dreams forever gone
Shadows dance in the quiet mist
What lies beyond the darkness
In beautiful darkness
Birds of death sing in the end
Beneath the starry skies
Forever sleeps the angel soul
You drowned with Sun
You broke my heart
In beautiful darkness
Birds of death sing in the end
Beneath the starry skies
Forever sleeps the angel soul

Drawn to Black
bykageyama
 作曲  Sevänen
 作词  Sevänen
Wreathed in silence, laid down in shades
Swathed in regrets, deluded astray
Forgotten in half-light, drawn in despair
Soothed in slumber so dreadful and fair
Rending and searing and twisting my dreams
Alone in the gloom with the nightmares unseen
The night has a thousand eyes,
And the day but one;
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun
The mind has a thousand eyes,
And the heart but one
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done
Worthless the pledges, all vows but lies
Fateful her kisses, where a serpent hides
First beckoned to step from the twilight to glare
Then left in the dark for the demons to share
The night has a thousand eyes,
And the day but one;
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun
The night has a thousand eyes,
And the day but one;
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun
The mind has a thousand eyes,
And the heart but one
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done
Only the stars see, only the moon hears…
And quietly the water-lilies sigh
Like the last breath of a weary soul
And the **** sway in the dreary waters
Like a girl’s dark hair they wave about
And the black stones under my bare feet
Cold and smooth like her milk-white palm
And the silence which falls upon this shore
Resounds now louder than oncoming storm
For all is gone
(Only the stars see, only the moon hears…)

So many things I can’t remember
Too many things I can’t forget
The thoughts that keep me awake and plague me with regret
A constant reminder of mistakes I cannot escape
A wretched ache that never leaves
The scars unseen
Caught in the shadow of a memory
My mind’s my enemy
My mind’s my enemy
These Demons
They’re haunting me - They’re all I see
These Demons
Threaten with destiny - It’s changing me
Can’t say you didn’t see it coming
And now you’re losing this war
You’re the only one in it now The others have moved on
So stop saving face and start saving your soul
Can’t keep living this way
Won’t dull this pain
Stop trying to fight it alone
Now let these Demons go
Let these Demons Go!
These Demons
They’re haunting me - They’re all I see

Threaten with destiny - It’s changing me

Lost Life
by大头板砖

You live in house for dying people
Next door stands old theatre
Which is closed
For too much long
As a time as you are alone
Beating the time by touching memories
Reading forgotten script
Wrinkled face
Ripped curtain
No mark seen in the dirty crypt
I am the man
Who's never spoken word
Who's never breathe fresh air
I'm dust on old red chair
I am the man
Who's never seen the play
Who's never to tried get there
I'm just running away
No more play, you lost a way
To change the fate which's ******* grave
You can hope but in a blame, only cry remains

Life has gone out of this place
Ghosts of past cover me
I am too old
My life is done
What can I do to stay alive
Looking through the window every hour
Once a man now zombie
Woken all night
She is your bride
Almost you are resting in grave
No more play, you lost a way
To change the fate which's ******* grave
You can hope but in a blame, only cry remains

No melody there in orchestra
Dark corners occupied by spiders
Just for once say goodbye
To the old man and his pain
For the last time switch on the lights
For the last time give me a chance
Stuck up cruel fate for the last time
Stuck up cruel fate give me a chance

I do nothing to feel better
Never did a right step
Never feel love
Never feel hate
Expecting nothing waiting for death
****
Never hit you a storm
You lose your life
I lose my soul
Fate you're a jocker and I am a worm
Worm without a privilege of existence
Better to smash you when
You come out from womb
The ****** tomb
Or kill me when I was in there
From the cradle to grave everything is blackened
Mountains of fear and shame
Lost life you have
Lost life I take
Six feet under is where I'll stay

Lemmings
by猪脑袋的趣味狗生
 作曲  Thierry Bertone
Sharpening incisors, crunching roots and bulbs
Moving short tails, rubbing soft furs
Winter's coming, sons are growing, chaos comes to town
Damn instinct, trigger-actions, avoiding the crowd
Merciless algorithm - drops the exp(onential) curve
Repetition of a race - drops the exp(onential) curve
We are just Lemmings and we won't come back
We are just Lemmings hiding our tracks
We are just Lemmings and we're drowning
We are just Lemmings into mourning
Follow the map we never saw
Dying in the point we tried to go
Look at the steps of those above
We are just Lemmings seeking for love

Licking tiny feet, running alongside the cliff
An eye to your fellow, your fellow to the cause
Feet and brains, furs and eyes, towards the same goal
Same flow, many Lemmings, the meaning of an ideal
Merciless algorithm - drops the exp(onential) curve
Repetition of a race - drops the exp(onential) curve
We are just Lemmings and we won't come back
We are just Lemmings hiding our tracks
We are just Lemmings and we're drowning
We are just Lemmings into mourning
Follow the map we never saw
Dying in the point we tried to go
Look at the steps of those above
We are just Lemmings seeking for love

We are just Lemmings and we won't come back
We are just Lemmings hiding our tracks
We are just Lemmings and we're drowning
We are just Lemmings into mourning
Follow the map we never saw
Dying in the point we tried to go
Look at the steps of those above
We are just Lemmings seeking for love
We are just Lemmings and we won't come back
We are just Lemmings hiding our tracks
We are just Lemmings and we're drowning
We are just Lemmings into mourning
Follow the map we never saw
Dying in the point we tried to go
Look at the steps of those above
We are just Lemming seeking for love

Ignite my veins with your blood to inspire new verses
I'm drained to my dregs
Replace my eyes with your fire to burn through the curses
Leave nothing that could hinder your blinding light
Test me in the furnace of affliction
Refine me as you wish
When the die is cast
Breathe in me your animating spark
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So take me now
It's not my blood to bleed
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So I cry out
The last word is yours to speak
Sharpen my tongue with precision only your words convey
I've kept waiting too long
Breathe in my lungs a passion that strangles corruption
Till there's nothing left

Heroes To Us
by月斜夕成玦
Old prophet's land
A battlefield of non-believers in a violent rage
A declaration of human rights a pretext
For maintenance of a new world order
Above all written laws a growth concept
Created by the patriot of the civilized world
Rearmament
Welfare state
Disarmament
Non-member state
Free market economy a consequence of military needs
Loss of lives
Human rights activists political pawn in a game
Nothing can they do without state subsidies
A gift of today`s world
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us!
Production at any price
Admiration of those who earn
With blood on their hands
We will never learn
A gift of today`s world
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us!

The faint blaze of the candle of my life,
slowly dying like a fire in a pouring rain
No sparks of hope inside,
no shooting stars on my sky
On broken wings, no flying high

Another night, another demise,
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice
I`ll let the wind blow out the light
cuz its gets more painful every time I die

Out of strenght to fight
I cannot take another night
I cannot take it no more
Lust of light slips through my fingers
like blood on my arms
Black candle wax has buried me

Another night, another demise,
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice
I`ll let the wind blow out the light

eradicate the lungs and take us higher
these are the wonders at your feet
weighed upon a wider scale
afraid to see what takes us down

search abandoned, let the blood be fevered

Friend or foe, there's no way to know
In the battlefield of life it's kill or be killed
So many times it's a matter of degrees
From being up on your luck to down on your knees
It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal
They try to change you, crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are
It's times like these when lines are drawn
Which side of the fence are you swinging on?
There will come one day not so far away
When the hunter becomes the prey (and you will pay)
It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal
They try to change you, crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall

Darkness still upon me,
All those empty words
from the buried heart
I don't know where fear ends
and where hate begins,
It's all the same to me,
Life is falling apart
Hand in handside by side
I walk with fate in the night
The red fluid of life is flowing right along my arms,
I feel the sweet blade diving deep inside,
This moment I've been waiting for so long a time,
when I know the last cut will be for my life
I've looked through the eyes of pain
and seen the smile of death
I've wandered in the shadows of my fears
The feathers of a white dove
were stained by darkened tears
The final tune is soon to be played
Hand in handside by side
I walk with death in the night

Save yourself

Save yourself

You're the perfect job when it hurts like hell

I never needed anyone so much

There's no-one else I love and I curse myself

Cause the right thing is too give you up

Overcome my shame cause I can never change

You can never understand my sickness

I never understand my sickness

Save yourself

From a life full of lies

and a heartfull of pain and sorrow

Save yourself

From the choices I make

because nothing but failure follows me
Save yourself

From a life full of lies

and a heartfull of pain and sorrow

Save yourself

From the choices I make

because nothing but failure follows me

Save yourself

Save yourself

You understand can my never sickness

I don't understand my sickness

Save yourself

From a life full of lies

and a heartfull of pain and sorrow

Save yourself

From the choices I make

because nothing but failure follows me

Save yourself

From a life full of lies

and a heartfull of pain and sorrow

Save yourself

Rhythm of wings in the sky so high
Music in my ears I can't wait to see
I' m hiding in the grass death in my hands
Surprise is my only defence
My private war against wilderness
Human mastermind versus animal instinct
And when the flock settles I pass my sentence
But none will die after the report
They rise into the air and fly away
But they will return
And I am all alone
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Still some day I'm hiding again
Waiting for the sound of stroking wings
And they will come spirit within
And in same place I miss them again
They rise into the air
And fly away
Yeah, they rise into the air
Butthey will return!

A dance beneath the sparkling sky,
the silent touch of vivid grace
your hand fits mine like a perfect match
we kids in lust and the night is young
the dance we share will guide the way
the unforgettable romance
you whisper "hope" like no one else
but only for tonight
i am the bullet in your gun
you've had me loaded since the day one
so play your cards right girl,
this beating heart is yours to break!
this soldier surrenders,
don't hesitate now,
this is what you wanted all along
with steady hands she makes her aim - oh oh oh-
she locks and loads are you in her way?
her smile hits the mark
she has those gorgeous piercing eyes,
red coloured lips that suck you dry
she is so fashion!
her words might seem to make things right,
but she will walk on your hopes and dreams tonight
she is so fashion, deadly fashion!
she's been the talk of our town
so we all know that her words are poison
she'll fake a smile when the timing right
but that cunt will stab you in the back
her eyes are set to make the top
she spread legs like a swing-door opens up
my bad, i started this rumour,
that you sell your mouth for a dollar!
and if i know her right, that precious little whore,
she's on her back screaming out for more
so if i know her right, that precious little whore,
she's screaming,she's screaming,she's screaming
with steady hands she makes her aim - oh oh oh-
she locks and loads, are you in her way?
her smile hits the mark
with steady hands she makes her aim - oh oh oh-
she locks and loads, are you in her way?
her smile hits the mark
you better shake-shake-shake your body!
to the beat that we're making
you better shake-shake-shake your body!
to the music that we're spreading
you better dance-dance-dance forever
you're only pretty when you're sweating
you better shake-shake-shake you body
as we sing to you!
as we sing to you!
as we sing to you!
you always try to get everyone's attention
yet you always fail in each and every way tonight

Princess of lust
Dignity put to dust

A virginal sight
Their apple to bite
Drink from my thighs
The rain of lies
A sight so cursed
Breasts which never nursed

An Aphrodite for mortal souls

Playing hide and seek in lecherous roles
Their erotic hour my tearless weep
Their satisfaction my infinite sleep

Naked limbs reflecting from the moon
I'll be there for you soon
First wish for this night
Let me be your delight
Body of a virgin
Soul to the Devil's kin

Your God is me
In all that you see
An Aphrodite for mortal souls
Playing hide and seek in lecherous roles
Their erotic hour my tearless weep
Their satisfaction my infinite sleep

by梅德韦姐夫
This ship is sinking deeper and deeper
We've abandoned this vessel and left the captain for dead
Waves thirst for our passing, waves thirst for our passing
Prepare for the struggle, prepare to engage
Our armor tight to the skin, this shield it bears his name
We are strapped to the teeth
But our swords are lodged tightly in our throats
We are going under
We cannot swim under these conditions
We're drowning quicker and quicker
We cannot swim, we cannot swim
We can't swim under these conditions
We are drowning quicker and quicker
We cannot swim, we cannot swim under these conditions
We have become what we have feared
We have become what we have feared
Being one with this world
We've become one with this world
Pray for heaven's titans to rain down, spare us the pain
We're going under, we're going under
Pray for heaven's titans to rain down, spare us the pain

They told me lies
There'll be no Eden nights
And thousand stars
Will sleep in emptiness
I once believed
In words of human world
But they can not guide me,
Not anymore
When life is gone and all is dead
You can not see me one last time
Where light will fade and time has come
This darkness takes the place of life
When time has come
This light will fade away
My thoughts are dark,
My dreams will die away
There is no light
In my shattered life
I this ground
In silence
When life is gone and all is dead
You can not see me one last time
Where light will fade and time has come
This darkness takes the place of life
When life is gone and all is dead

Judgement
byJegvar
There was a time when I could speak to the Lord
A burning heart that made a real mystery unfold
I won't remember what is lost in tug of greed
In an ideal world that was made for me to see
It creates the atmosphere of fear
Pain, lots of pain come into my ears
Drown slowly in the river of tears
True enemies are drawing near
Screams of agony within this violent storm
The day the child died, the day he was born
Souls of dead gather waiting for this judgement day
Glory of this sacred day fades to gray
The only thing is, but it's always failed
Never ends, returns everyday
At the final gate, some began to pray
To get ready for doomsday
The power and protection
Belief in Jesus's resurrection
It haven't supported, helped us ever
Our souls are damned forever
I Joined those whose life departed, that'll be my doom
No daylight under the unholy darkest moon
Renewal to the highest ultimate degree
The verge on the meaningless, they sent to set it free
It creates the atmosphere of fear
Pain, lots of pain come into my ears
Drown slowly in the river of tears
True enemies are drawing near
Screams of agony within this violent storm
The day the child died, the day he was born
Souls of dead gather waiting for this judgement day
Glory of this sacred day fades to gray

It all begins from this point and it's the point for all this to end
Every story has got an ending, but his is the one
That keeps going without it
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me!
I pull the trigger to escape
I have followed the path and walked through the door
I have hated you so much, but now I know
It would be pointless forevermore
Countless nights spent on just pacing under the streetlights
This is the part of the play where the hero is sentenced to death
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me!
I pull the trigger to escape
Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge

Defeat
Wasting feeling breeding inside me
A shadow of something crawling behind me
And I'm pretending there's nothing in there
But hearing those whispers makes me to believe
Here - I lay in my bed tasting bitter sweet
Smell - In my breathe reminding smell of death
Dreams - In my head slowly fade away
The end - Is nearby me and I want it to be
The king - Inside my head seducing me to betray
You - The only one making myself me
The loss -In my life great it will be
The game -Is taking me and the prize is defeat
Defeat
Inevitable, my destiny
Defeat
Best friend I've ever met
Defeat
Inevitable, my destiny
Hands stretching up to reach the sky
Grobing for a lifehold a place to stay
Fingers are slipping and I'm falling down
Into the world I know the world of sadness
Room -In my heart empty as a well
Still -Waiting for the victory to take
In vain -I've lost this game before I've even born
Defeat -My destiny all I ever get
Inevitable, my destiny
Defeat
Best friend I've ever met
Defeat
Inevitable, my destiny
Defeat
Best friend I've ever met

And nothing will be left for them
Of all their vanity
Of all this selfishness

The Cleansing
Out from the darkened night,
Into the burning hot cleansing steam
My weak endeavour to stay clean;
From all the filth that I've gladly taken in
Failed escape from reality;
My soul lies unwanted with a stain of sin
I feel myself impure;
I need the cleansing;
Craving for more of your love
I feel myself unclean;
I need the cleansing;
Oh, wash me clean from these stains in me
Out from the hot burning steam,
Into the frozen cold granular snow
The filth I've seen on my way;
Hasn't stain me like the evil from within
Evil deeds and words I say;
I've soiled my soul with a stain of sin
I feel myself impure;
I need the cleansing;
Craving for more of your love
I feel myself unclean;
I need your blessing;
Only you can clean these stains in me

She was the key to my darkest heart
Holding hands with the seekers of the path
A forced face from the lingering hate
A fake grace for the closing eyes in the crowd
Reverse your rightness, let go of control
Beware of the denying, it's in your hall
You have the same ability to do as them
Don't count your mistakes, get in the line and do what it takes
She was the weakest in the world of liars
Maybe the only one left that was telling the whole truth
Waiting for that moment again in this misplaced childhood
Ready to faint she will accept it, clutching at the tears in her mind
The flock didn't pay in pain like the others
Body to the ground, gravel in those tiny eyes
For each day she struggles the degradation
Forever bound to walk the fields of disgrace
She was the key to my darkest heart
Holding hands with the seekers of the path
A forced face from the lingering hate
A fake grace for the closing eyes in the crowd
She was the weakest in the world of liars
Maybe the only one left that was telling the whole truth
Waiting for that moment again in this misplaced childhood
Ready to faint she will accept it, clutching at the tears in her mind

Knee-deep in a lake of fire
Radiated, mutated
Fade away to the darkness

Shattered dreams, twisted nightmares
All I hear is everlasting silence
A flash of bright light in the night
My mind got clearer, focusing thoughts

In the coming days I can see the new dawn of man
No more dead and gone, no more lost in the desert sand
In the distant skies, roaring storm cracks open the sky
We're rising from the shadows in the wasteland

I see patterns in darkened forms
All the colors are out of space
Visions unlike I've never seen or known
All fade away as I feel the shiver

Here we are at last
Millennia passed
And nothing's changed
At all
They're still in control
A plague upon my soul
It's all so strange
And wrong
A world pushed by fear
Accepts the lies they hear
You are part of their plan
Just puppets in their hands
Time is running out
But if you learn to doubt
Maybe hope remains
We've run ourselves into the ground
You had your lives to live
Your knowledge you could give
And yet you choose to die
Why?
Infection spreading all around
A virus of the mind
A destroyer of lives
I'm begging to you try
And survive
You ignore the truth
Your mind's are polluted
And you slow progress
There is nothing brave
In accepting insane
Lies without evidence
A world pushed by fear
Accepts the lies they hear
You are part of their plan
Just puppets in their hands
Time is running out
But if you learn to doubt
Maybe hope remains
