Trooper
Iron Maiden - The Trooper
You＇ll take my life but I＇ll take yours too
You＇ll fire your musket but I＇ll run you through
So when you＇re waiting for the next attack
You＇d better stand there＇s no turning back
The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won＇t live to fight another day
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body＇s numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Wasted Years
From the coast of gold, Across the seven seas

I'm travlin on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else

I close my eyes, and think of home

Another city goes by, In the night

Ain't it funny how it is

You never miss it till it's gone away
And my heart is lying there

And will be to my dying day

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those
Wasted Years
Face upmake your stand

And realize your living in the golden years
Too much time on hands, I got you on my mind

Can't ease this pain, So easily

When you can't find the words to say

It's hard to make it through another day

And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those
Wasted Years

Face upmake your stand

And realize your living in the golden years

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those
Wasted Years
Face upmake your stand
And realize your living in the golden years

So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those
Wasted Years
Face upmake your stand
And realize your living in the golden years

Fear Of The Dark (1998 Digital Remaster)
Iron Maiden  - Fear Of The Dark

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark
Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light ?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there ?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there
SOLO
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  xN
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense,and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind
When I'm walking a dark road

Run to the Hills
 作词  Harris
White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for cree
Oh will we ever be set free?
Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom a stab in the back
Women and children and cowards attack
Run to the hills run for your lives
Run to the hills run for your lives
Soldier blue on the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good indians are tame
Selling them whisky and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old
Run to the hills run for your lives
**********************************************
Paranoid
 作词  Butler, Iommi, Osbourne, Ward
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think I'm insame because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy

Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?

Oh yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness' I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

Enter Sandman
 作词  Hammett, Hetfield, Ulrich
Say your prayers little one
don''t forget, my son
to include everyone
tuck you in, warm within
keep you free from sin
till the sandman he comes
sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight
exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land
something''s wrong, shut the light
heavy thoughts tonight
and they aren''t of snow white
dreams of war, dreams of liars
dreams of dragon''s fire
and of things that will bite
sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight
exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land
now I lay me down to sleep
pray the lord my soul to keep
if I die before I wake
pray the lord my soul to take
hush little baby, don''t say a word
and never mind that noise you heard
it''s just the beast under your bed,
in your closet, in your head
exit light
enter night
grain of sand
exit light
enter night
take my hand
we''re off to never never land

The Four Horsemen
 作曲  James Hetfield/Lars Ulrich/Dave Mustaine
 作词  James Hetfield
By  the  last  breath  of  the  fourth  winds  blow
Better  raise  your  ears
The  sound  of  hooves  knocks  at  your  door
Lock  up  your  wife  and  children  now
It's  time  to  wield  the  blade
For  now  you  have  got  some  company
The  Horsemen  are  drawing  nearer
On  the  leather  steeds  they  ride
They  have  come  to  take  your  life
On  through  the  dead  of  night
With  the  four  Horsemen  ride
or  choose  your  fate  and  die
You  have  been  dying  since  the  day
You  were  born
You  know  it  has  all  been  planned
The  quartet  of  deliverance  rides
A  sinner  once  a  sinner  twice
No  need  for  confession  now
Cause  now  you  have  got  the  fight  of  your  life
The  Horsemen  are  drawing  nearer
On  the  leather  steeds  they  ride
They  have  come  to  take  your  life
On  through  the  dead  of  night
With  the  four  Horsemen  ride
or  choose  your  fate  and  die
Time
has  taken  its  toll  on  you
The  lines  that  crack  your  face
Famine
Your  body  it  has  torn  through
Withered  in  every  place
Pestilence
For  what  you  have  had  to  endure
And  what  you  have  put  others  through
Death
Deliverance  for  you  for  sure
There  is  nothing  you  can  do
So  gather  round  young  warriors  now
and  saddle  up  your  steeds
Killing  scores  with  demon  swords
Now  is  the  death  of  doers  of  wrong
Swing  the  judgment  hammer  down
Safely  inside  armor  blood  guts  and  sweat
The  Horsemen  are  drawing  nearer
On  the  leather  steeds  they  ride
They  have  come  to  take  your  life
On  through  the  dead  of  night
With  the  four  Horsemen  ride
or  choose  your  fate  and  die

Now That We’re Dead
byRentzKE
When darkness falls
May it be
That we should see the light
When reaper calls
May it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns
May it be
The faith shall permeate our scars
When we're seduced
Then may it be
That we not deviate our cause
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain
May it be
It's all we've ever known
When flame consumes
May it be
It warms our dying bones
When loss has won
May it be
It's you I'm madly fighting for
When kingdom comes
May it be
We walk right through that open door
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future

Beginning, the ending
Return to ash
Now that we're dead, my dear

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever

Come rally round this lack of freedom

Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives of danger
It's bound to explode
Aim for the target
With laser and lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight
No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace

We fight this firepower

I'll bring you the head of the demon

The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
Twisted dreams that are formed from illusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
Lightning will strike!

One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words
Yeah-h

You're broke down you're fed up
Your lungs start to shout
You're wincing, convulsing
You're aching with pain
Gasping for breath, and you're feeling insane
Hole after hole
Just proving your point
Point after point
Just digging you hole
Slow digging with a spoon
Hooked!
You're hooked on a drug that's controlling your mind
Hocking your soul for that measly last dime
You're dragged off and thrown in your own padded cell

Thin steel prick cums in your arm

Holy Wars...The Punishment Due
Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand
Fools like me, who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's command?
A country that's divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be in your homelands
Holy wars
Upon my podium, as the
Know it all scholar
Down in my seat of judgement
Gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader
Out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier
Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God
Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
Behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they diethey die
They killed my wife, and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistakelast mistake!
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
Next mistakeno more mistakes!
Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't
thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
mercy killings
mercy killings

Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away

Finished with my woman 'cause
she couldn't help me with my mind
people think that I'm insane
because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things
but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?

Oh yeah yeah oh yeah

I need someone to show me the things
in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness,
I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh
and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I can not feel
so love to me us so unreal

And so as you hear these
words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late

The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask youre wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry ow
And when the story takes a twist
If folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry
The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravitys got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again
And again and again, again
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry ow

"Tornado Of Souls" “

This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry
Not for the money, not for the fame
Not for the power, just no more games

But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a  days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years, not from the use
Not from the tears, just self abuse

But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a  days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

Who's to say what's for me to say
Who's to say what's for me to be
Who's to say what's for me to do
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me

The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Solo   (by Marty Friedman)

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel
I warn you of the fate
Proven true to late
Your tongue twist perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death

Peace Sells
What do you mean, 'I don't believe in God'?
I talk to him every day
What do you mean, 'I don't support your system'?
I go to court when I have to
What do you mean, 'I can't get to work on time'?
I got nothing better to do
And, what do you mean, 'I don't pay my bills'?
Why do you think I'm broke? Huh?
Chorus
If there's a new way,
I'll be the first in line
But, it better work this time
What do you mean, 'I hurt your feelings'?
I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean, 'I ain't kind'?
I'm just not your kind
What do you mean, 'I couldn't be president, of the United States of America'?
Tell me something, it's still 'We the people', right?
Chorus
If there's a new way
I'll be the first in line,
But, it better work this time
Can you put a price on peace?
Peace,
Peace sells,
Peace,

Peace sells,but who's buying?
Peace sells,but who's buying?
Peace sells,but who's buying?
Peace sells,but who's buying?

Skin O' My Teeth (Remastered)
I had wrists donning slits
Flowing constantly
My broken body in a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit and run
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser in my room
My wet brain neighbor cranes
His neck to see in time
The white lights a train
Bearing down on me
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
I wont feel the hurt
Im not trash any longer
That that doesnt kill me
Only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue
Thats what  is for
So, tag my toe and dont forget
Ooh to close the drawer
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth

Dread And The Fugitive Mind
 作曲  Dave Mustaine
 作词  Dave Mustaine
Let me introduce myself
I 'm a social disease
I 've come for your wealth
And leave you on your knees
No time for feeling sorry
I got here on my own
I won 't ask for mercy
I choose to walk alone
What 's yours is mine and what 's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand better count your fingers
What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgement?
If I 'm right I lose nothing
If you 're right I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because I 'm doing something wicked
I 'm guilty haunted by my fears
And the only consequences
Are dread and the fugitive mind
You built walls to protect you
So no one will infect you
Pursued by those out there
That vanish in thin air
Come a long way to find
What you really left behind
You don 't know when the end is
But it 's coming fast
What 's yours is mine and what 's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand better count your fingers
What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgement?
If I 'm right I lose nothing
If you 're right I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because I 'm doing something wicked
I 'm guilty haunted by my fears
And the only consequences
Are dread and the fugitive mind

sadist of the noblest blood
destroying, without mercy
to benefit the aryan race

strapped down screaming out to die

infamous butcher,
angel of death
pumped with fluid, inside your brain
pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
burning flesh, drips away
test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
frigid cold, cracks your limbs
how long can you last
in this frozen water burial?
sewn together, joining heads
just a matter of time
'til you rip yourselves apart
millions laid out in their
crowded tombs
sickening ways to achieve
the holocaust
seas of blood, bury life
smell your death as it burns
deep inside of you
abacinate, eyes that bleed
praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare
wings of pain, reach out for you
his face of death staring down,
your blood running cold
injecting cells, dying eyes
feeding on the screams of
the mutants he's creating
pathetic harmless victims
left to die
rancid angel of death
flying free

Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck
Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind
Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live
New life born from the oppressed
Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near
Fatality, reality, you await the final call
My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever
Share insanity
Do you want to die!
The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death

An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs
Judgment day the second coming arrives
Before you see the light you must die

Forgotten children, conform a new faith,
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
thenever ending search for your shattered sanity,
Souls of damnation in their own reality
Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters,
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
Engreat souls condemned for alleternity,
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity
Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath
On and on, south of heaven x 

Lead king
The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
A never ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity
Chaos rampant,

Memories linger in my brain
Of burning from the acid rain
A pain I never have won
Nothing here remains
No future and no past
No one could foresee
The end that came so fast
Hear the prophet make his guess
That paradise lies to the west
So join his quest for the sun
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be
The world slowly decays
Destruction fills my eyes
Harboring the image
Of a spiraling demise
Burning winds release their fury
Simulating judge and jury
Drifting flurries of pain
Deafening silence reigns
As twilight fills the sky
Eventual supremacy
As daylight waits to die
Darkness always calls my name
A pawn in this recurring game
Humanity going insane
Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be
Fragments of what used to be
Skeletons of society
Minutes seem like days
Corrosion fills the sky
Morbid dreams of anarchy
Brought judgment in disguise
Memories linger in my brain
Life with nothing more to gain
Perpetual madness remains
Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be
Fragments of what used to be
Skeletons of society

Dead Skin Mask
by不朽之风的赞美诗
 作曲  Araya/Hanneman
Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead cold flesh pacifies the means
Provocative images delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants
In the depths of a mind insane
Fantasy and reality are the same
Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead warm flesh pacifies the means
Incised members ornaments on my being
Adulating the skin before me
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control

War Ensemble
作曲  Araya, Hanneman, Hanneman
  Propaganda death ensemble
 Burial to be
 Corpses rotting through the night
 In blood laced misery
 Scorched earth the policy
 The reason for the siege
 The pendulum it shaves the blade
 The strafing air blood raid
 
 Infiltration push reserves
 Encircle the front lines
 Supreme art of strategy
 Playing on the minds
 Bombard till submission
 Take all to their graves
 Indication of triumph
 The numbers that are dead
 
 (Chorus)
 Sport the war, war support
 The sport is war, total war
 When victory's a massacre sings 'really massacre' st time, 'really survival' nd
 The final swing is not a drill
 It's how many people I can kill
 
 (Chorus)
 
 Be dead fiend from above
 When darkness falls
 Descend onto my sights
 Your fallen walls
 Spearhead break through the lines
 Flanked all around
 Soldiers of attrition
 Forward their ground
 Regime prophetic age
 Old in its time
 Flowing veins run on through
 Deep in the Rhine
 Center of the web
 All battles scored
 What is our war crimes
 (era forever more war)
 
 Propaganda war ensemble
 Burial to be
 Bones shining by the night
 In blood laced misery
 Campaign of elimination
 Twisted psychology
 When victory is to survive
 And death is defeat
 
 Sport the war, war support
 The sport is war, total war
 When victory's a massacre doesn't sing this
 When victory is survival　or this!
 When this end is a slaughter
 The final swing is not a drill
 It's how many people I can kill

Repentless！
Slayer！
Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every ******’ day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the ******’ scene
Pissing match of egos, **** their vanity
Ain’t got the time, I don’t want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you ******’ do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see
Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride
My songs relive the atrocities of war
Can’t take society any ******’ more
Intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
Playing this **** is all that keeps me alive
I leave it all on the road living on the stage
This is my life where I kill it everyday
So take you shot, bottom’s up, this is no lie
I’ll be beating this guitar ’til the day I die
Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate ******’ scene
Pissing match of egos, **** their vanity
Ain’t got the time, I don’t want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you ******’ do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see
We’re all killing ourselves a little more everyday
Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

Seasons In The Abyss
 作曲  Araya, Hanneman
 作词  Araya Hanneman
Razors edge,outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipaton,the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration
Close your eyes……
Look deep in your soul……
Step outside yourself……
And let your mind go……
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind……
As you die……
Close your eyes……
And forget your name……
Step outside yourself……
And let your thoughts drain……
As you go insane……

Innate need to watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated eviscerated
Time perpetuated
Close your eyes……
Look deep in your soul……
Step outside yourself……
And let your mind go……
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind……
As you die……
Close your eyes……
And forget your name……
Step outside yourself……
And let your thoughts drain……
As you go insane……

Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals
Close your eyes……
Look deep in your soul……
Step outside yourself……
And let your mind go……
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind……
As you die…………
Close your eyes……
And forget your name……
Step outside yourself……
And let your thoughts drain……
As you go insane……
go insane……

Piece By Piece
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece
You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I＇ll rip your flesh ＇till there＇s no breath
Dismembered destiny
As soon as life has left your corpse
I＇ll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece
Bones and blood lie on the ground
Rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found
On my wall, your head!
On your trail I close the gap
One more life that soon won＇t be
No emotion
Your flesh is all I need
I＇ll send you to your maker
Confront the God you seek
A flash of red upon your chest
Safety out of reach
You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I＇ll rip your flesh ＇till there＇s no breath
Dismembered destiny
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
There＇s only one way out of here

作曲  LINDBERG/Larsson/Erlandsson/Bjorler
To rid the earth of the filth
To rid the earth of the lies
To will the rise above
Tearing my insides out
I feel my soul go cold
Only the dead are smiling
To rid your heart of all lies
Their poison tongues, poison hearts
Burning cold&
Now let the final darkness fall
"&The dream of the new disease
On wings of euphoria&
Sucking terror from the needle scars&"
 years of pain
And I can feel it closing in
The will to rise above
Tearing my insides out

Waiting to be born'

I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
Born of the demon sky
Twisting reality
Sweet nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
I cast aside my chains

Fall from reality

The face of all your fears
Now covered with sores

Walk with Me In Hell
 作曲  Lamb Of God
Pray for blood
Pray for the cleansing
Pray for the flood
Pray for end of this nightmare
This lie of a life can as quickly as it came dissolve

We seek only reprieve
And welcome the darkness
The myth of a meaning, so lost and forgotten

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell

Pray for solace
Pray for resolve
Pray for a savior
Pray for deliverance
Some kind of purpose, a glimpse of a light in this void of existence

Oh
Now witness the end of an age
Hope dies in hands of believers
Who seek the truth in the liar's eyes

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Take hold of my hand

For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

Walk with me in hell

You're never alone
You're never alone
You're never alone

You're never alone
You're never alone
Walk with me in hell

Fury Of The Storm
 作曲  Totman
Woh  woh  wohhhhhhhh
We  are  riding  for  the  battlefield  in  force  tonight
Fury  of  the  darkest  evil  cry  for  war
Far  beyond  the  boundaries  of  hell  and  starlight
On  the  road  to  lands  unknown  forever  more
Through  the  caverns  far  below  our  quest  will  lead  us
Onwards  through  the  ice  and  snow  forever  more
Standing  fighting  full  of  hate  the  time  has  come  now
Stand  and  sound  the  guns  of  glory  cry  for  war
On  wings  of  glory  we  will  carry  on
Far  across  forgotten  lands  towards  the  distant  sun
And  in  the  darkness  shining  far  beyond  the  starlight
Lightning  is  striking  from  the  dark  dawning  shadows
And  in  the  kingdom  of  the  everlasting  sun
When  the  glory  of  the  master's  time  has  come!
Into  the  fires  of  forever  we  will  fly  through  the  heavens
With  the  power  of  the  universe  we  stand  strong  together
Through  the  force  in  our  power,it  will  soon  reach  the  hour
For  victory  we  ride,Fury  of  the  Storm!
Here  we  are  the  chosen  ones  we  can  not  fail  now
Spilling  all  the  blood  on  the  fires  below
Smashing  through  the  boundaries  with  the  fire  and  fury
Killing  all  the  mortals  down  the  winding  road
Hellfires  are  raging  the  storm  growing  strong
On  the  path  to  victory  towards  the  distant  sun
And  in  the  darkness  shining  far  beyond  the  starlight
Lightning  is  striking  from  the  dark  dawning  shadows
And  in  the  kingdom  of  the  everlasting  sun
When  the  glory  of  the  master's  time  has  come!
Into  the  fires  of  forever  we  will  fly  through  the  heavens

Through  the  force  in  our  power,it  will  soon  reach  the  hour
For  victory  we  ride,Fury  of  the  Storm!
Into  the  fires  of  forever  we  will  fly  through  the  heavens
With  the  power  of  the  universe  we  stand  strong  together
Into  the  fires  of  forever  we  will  fly  through  the  heavens

Don't be afraid just move ahead
遮られた大地へ
Don't look back keep on going

叫びに絡みつく己の哀しみが
Don't hesitate don't lose your way

今取り戻す為
刹那の迷いさえ未来を奪いゆく
溢れる怒りもこの手に握りしめ

Fighting the evil bringing all peace
I'll fly over world on wings of justice
Chasing the evil until the honor will rule again
Just fight against the traitor flames rage in my heart
こぼれ落ちそうな想いを乗せて
Wielding my sword I face the overwhelming evil
猛る焔を纏って
Let us scream just move ahead

行く手を封じる眼前の脅威さえ
足取り途切れず薙ぎ倒し続けて

Rhythm of wings in the sky so high
Music in my ears I can't wait to see
I' m hiding in the grass death in my hands
Surprise is my only defence
My private war against wilderness
Human mastermind versus animal instinct
And when the flock settles I pass my sentence
But none will die after the report
They rise into the air and fly away
But they will return
And I am all alone
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge
Still some day I'm hiding again
Waiting for the sound of stroking wings
And they will come spirit within
And in same place I miss them again
They rise into the air
And fly away
Yeah, they rise into the air
Butthey will return!

Mirror Of Sins
by自闭式怀旧
How did I fall？
How did I come to this ?
I have thought past was a past
Now I'm taking a look into the glass
Searching for a light
some kind of my delight
Which I can't find !
Now I can see myself
In the mirror of my sins !
Wind recalls my deeds
An abstract of my life
All is spoiled and destroyed
Now I see what I have done !
As I stand here, I'm living dead
My heart is black and soul is fading
Is it real ?
Or is it sum of all my fears ?
Now I'm taking a look into the glass
Searching for a light
some kind of my delight
Which I can't find !
Now I can see myself
In the mirror of my sins !
In the mirror In the mirror In the mirror of my sins
